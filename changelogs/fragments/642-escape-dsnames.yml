enhancement:
- job.py: new tool available called _dsname_escape.
    Routine called _dsname_escape will ensure a dataset is escaped for cmd line compatibility.
    It will also raise an error if any data set name rules are violated.

bugfix:
- zos_data_set: Uses new _dsname_escape to make sure data set names are usable.
