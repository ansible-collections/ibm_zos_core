# Playbook Documentation
An [Ansible playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html#playbooks-intro) consists of organized instructions that define work for a managed node (hosts) to be managed with Ansible.

Included in __Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z core collection__ is a playbooks directory that will contain any number of sample playbooks that with little modification to the __inventory__, __ansible config__ and __group_vars__ can be run with the `ansible-playbook` command. 

You can find the playbook content that is included with the collection where the collection was installed, please refer back to the [installation documentation](../README.md#installation). In the following examples, this documment will refer to the installation path as `~/.ansible/collections/ibm/ibm_zos_core`. 

# Sample Playbook Configuration and Setup

## Ansible Config
Ansible config `ansible.cfg` can override nearly all `ansible-playbook` configurations. Also included in the [playbooks/](./) directory is a sample `ansible.cfg` that with little modificaton can supplement `ansible-playbook`.

In the sample `ansible.cfg`, the only required configuration is:   
`pipelining = True`

For more information about available configurations for `ansible.cfg`, read the Ansible documentation on [Ansible configuration settings](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#ansible-configuration-settings-locations)

## Inventory
Ansible works with multiple managed nodes (hosts) at the same time, using a list or group of lists know as an [inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html). Once the inventory is defined, you can use [patterns](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_patterns.html#intro-patterns) to select the hosts, or groups, you want Ansible to run against.

Included in the  [playbooks/](./) directory is a sample [inventory](./inventory) file that with little modification can be used to manage your nodes. This inventory file should be included when running the sample playbook. 

```
zsystem:
  hosts:
    zvm:
      ansible_host: zos_target_address
      ansible_user: zos_target_username
      ansible_python_interpreter: path_to_python_interpreter_binary_on_zos_target
```

The value for property __ansible_host__ is the hostname of the manage node; for example:  
   `ansible_host: ec33017A.vmec.svl.ibm.com`

The value for property __zos_target_username__ is the user name to use when connecting to the host; for example:  
   `ansible_user: omvsadm`
   
The value for property __ansible_python_interpreter__ is the target host python path. This is useful for systems with more than one Python installation, or when Python is not located at in the default location __/usr/bin/python__.  
   `ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/lpp/rsusr/python36/bin/python`
   
For more information on python configuration requirements on z/OS, refer to [Ansible FAQ: Running on z/OS](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/faq.html).
   
## Group Vars
Although you can store variables in the inventory file, storing separate host and group variables files may help you organize your variable values more easily. Included with the sample playbook is a sample variable file located in [./group_vars/all.yml](./group_vars/all.yml).

The value for property __BPXK_AUTOCVT__ must be configured to `ON`.   

The value for property __ZOAU_ROOT__ is the ZOA Utilities install root path, for example: `/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil`.

The value for property __PYTHONPATH__ is the ZOA Utilities Python library path, for example: `/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/lib/`.

The value for property __LIBPATH__ is both the path to the python libraries on the target and the ZOA Utilities Python library path separated by semi-colons `:`, for example: `/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/lib/:/usr/lpp/rsusr/python36/lib:/lib:/usr/lib:.`.

The value for property __PATH__ is the ZOA utilities BIN path and Python interpreter path, for example: `/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/bin;/usr/bin/python`.

```
environment_vars:
    _BPXK_AUTOCVT: ON
    ZOAU_ROOT: '/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil'
    PYTHONPATH: '/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/lib'
    LIBPATH: '/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/lib/:/usr/lpp/rsusr/python36/lib:/usr/lib:/lib:.'
    PATH: '/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/bin;/usr/lpp/rsusr/python36/bin/python'
```

## Run the playbook

To run the sample Ansible playbook, ensure you are within the collection playbooks directory where the sample files are included: `~/.ansible/collections/ibm/ibm_zos_core/playbooks/`   

Use the Ansible command `ansible-playbook` to run the sample playbook, the command syntax is `ansible-playbook -i <inventory> <playbook>`; for example: `ansible-playbook -i inventory zos-collection-sample.yaml`   

This command assumes the controller public SSH key has been shared with the managed node. If you want to avoid entering a username and password each time, copy the SSH public key to the managed node useing the `ssh-copy-id` command. For example: `ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub user@<hostname>`   

Alternatively, you can use the `--ask-pass` option to be promted for the users password each time a playbook is run, for example: `ansible-playbook -i inventory zos-collection-sample.yaml --ask-pass`   
   
_Note_: 
  * Using `--ask-pass` is not recommended because it will hinder performance. 
  * using `--ask-pass` requires `sshpass` be installed on the controller, for more information follow the [link](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sshpass)  
  
Optionally, during playbook execution, logging to the console verbosity can be configured. This is helpful in situations where communication is failing and you want more detail. To adjust logging verbosity, append more letter `v`'s, for example: `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`, or `-vvvv`.   

Each letter `v` increases logging vebosity similar to traditional logging levels INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG.
