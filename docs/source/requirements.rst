Requirements
============

A control node is any machine with Ansible installed. From the control node,
you can run commands and playbooks from a laptop, desktop, or server.
However, you cannot run **IBM z/OS core collection** on a Windows system.

A managed node is often referred to as a target node, or host, and it is managed
by Ansible. Ansible need not be installed on a managed node, but SSH must be
enabled.

The nodes listed below require these specific versions of software:

Control node
------------

* `Ansible version`_: 2.9 or later
* `Python`_: 2.7 or later
* `OpenSSH`_

.. _Ansible version:
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html
.. _Python:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/release/latest
.. _OpenSSH:
   https://www.openssh.com/


Managed node
------------

* `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_
* z/OS `V2R3`_ or `later`_
* `IBM Z Open Automation Utilities`_ (ZOAU)

   * IBM z/OS core collections are dependent on specific versions of ZOAU.
     For information about the required version of ZOAU, review the
     `release notes`_.
* `z/OS OpenSSH`_

If the Ansible target is z/OS, you must install
**IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS** which is ported for the z/OS platform
and required by **IBM z/OS core Collection**.

**Installation**

* Visit the `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_ product page for FMID,
  program directory, fix list, latest PTF, installation and configuration
  instructions.
* For reference, the Program IDs are:

  * NNNN-ZZZ for the base product
  * NNNN-ZZZ for service and support
* For the Python supported version, refer to the `release notes`_.
