    zos_mvs_raw - Ensures that temporary datasets created by DD Statements use the tmp_hlq specified.
    This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ)
    used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the
    defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override
    the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/414).
