minor_changes:
  - zos_copy - Adds new option `identical_gdg_copy` in the module.
    This allows copying GDG generations from a source base to a destination base
    while preserving generation data set absolute names when the destination base does not exist prior to the copy.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2100)
trivial:
  - test_zos_copy_func - added test case to verify the gds names are preserved with destination base does not 
    existing prior to the copy.
