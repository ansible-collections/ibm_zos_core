bugfixes:
  - zos_mvs_raw - If a program failed with a non-zero return code and verbose was false, the module would succeed.
    Whereas, if the program failed and verbose was true the module would fail(false positive).
    Fix now has a consistent behavior and fails in both cases.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1799).
  - zos_mvs_raw - Module would obfuscate the return code from the program when failing returning 8 instead.
    Fix now returns the proper return code from the program.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1799).
  - zos_mvs_raw - Module would return the stderr content in stdout when verbose was true and return code was 0.
    Fix now does not replace stdout content with stderr.
