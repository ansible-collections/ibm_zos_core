minor_changes:
- zos_copy - was enhanced for when `src` is a directory and ends with "/", the
  contents of it will be copied into the root of `dest`. It it doesn't end with
  "/", the directory itself will be copied.

- zos_copy - fixes a bug where options were not defined in the module
  argument spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core`
  v2.11 and using options `force` or `mode`.
