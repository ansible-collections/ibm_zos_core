=========
Playbooks
=========

An `Ansible playbook`_ consists of organized instructions that define work for
a managed node (host) to be managed with Ansible.

.. _Ansible playbook:
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html#playbooks-intro

Sample playbooks that demonstrate how to use the collection content are
**included** in the **IBM z/OS core collection**. You can find the samples on
`Github`_ or in the collections playbooks directory included with the
installation. For more information about the collections installation and
hierarchy, refer to the main `installation`_ documentation.

.. _Github:
   https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/tree/master/playbooks

.. _installation:
   https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/installation/installation.html

You can run the sample playbook with the ``ansible-playbook`` command with some
modification to the **inventory**, **ansible.cfg** and **group_vars**.

Configuration
=============

Each release of Ansible provides options in addition to the ones identified in
the sample configurations that are included with this collection. These options
allow you to customize how Ansible operates in your environment. Ansible
supports several sources to configure its behavior and all sources follow the
Ansible `precedence rules`_.

Although the collection includes sample configurations, it also provides a
playbook (`host-setup`_) that will attempt to locate Ansible dependencies on
a z/OS system and use them to generate a valid **inventory** and **host_vars**
file for the host.

.. _host-setup:
   https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/blob/dev/playbooks/host-setup.yaml

The Ansible configuration file `ansible.cfg` can override almost all
``ansible-playbook`` configurations. Included in the `playbooks directory`_ is a
sample `ansible.cfg`_ that can supplement ``ansible-playbook`` with a
little modification.

In `ansible.cfg`_, the only required configuration is ``pipelining = True``.
Setting the ``pipelining = True`` is **required** because it overrides the
default behavior which is to transfer Ansible modules to the target in binary
via SFTP. However, this will fail with the error:

.. warning::
   SyntaxError: Non-UTF-8 code starting with '\x83' in file
   /a/user1/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1548232945.35-274513842609025/
   AnsiballZ_stat.py on line 1, but no encoding declared;
   see https://python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/ for details

Setting ``pipelining = True`` in `ansible.cfg`_ will prevent this error.

You can specify the SSH port used by Ansible and instruct Ansible where to
write the temporary files on the target. This can be easily done by adding the
options to your inventory or to `ansible.cfg`.

An example of adding these options to `ansible.cfg` is shown below. For additional
details, see the sample `ansible.cfg`_ notes.

.. code-block:: yaml

   [defaults]
   forks = 25
   remote_tmp = /u/ansible/tmp
   remote_port = 2022

For more information about available configurations for ``ansible.cfg``, read

Inventory
---------

Ansible works with multiple managed nodes (hosts) at the same time, using a
list or group of lists known as an `inventory`_. Once the inventory is defined,
you can use `patterns`_ to select the hosts or groups that you want Ansible to
run against.

Included in the `playbooks directory`_ is a `sample inventory file`_ that can be
used to manage your nodes with a little modification. This inventory file
should be included when running the sample playbook.

.. code-block:: yaml

   zsystem:
     hosts:
       zvm:
         ansible_host: zos_target_address
         ansible_user: zos_target_username
         ansible_python_interpreter: path_to_python_interpreter_binary_on_zos_target


The value for the property **ansible_host** is the hostname of the managed node;
for example, ``ansible_host: ec33017A.vmec.svl.ibm.com``

The value for the property **zos_target_username** is the user name to use when
connecting to the host; for example, ``ansible_user: omvsadm``.

The value for the property **ansible_python_interpreter** is the target host
Python path. This is useful for systems with more than one Python installation,
or when Python is not installed in the default location **/usr/bin/python**;
for example,
``ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz/bin/python3``

For more information on Python configuration requirements on z/OS, refer to
Ansible `FAQ`_.

Behavioral inventory parameters such as ``ansible_port`` which allows you
to set the port for a host can be reviewed in the
`behavioral inventory parameters`_.

Group_vars
----------

Although you can store variables in the inventory file, storing separate host
and group variables files may help you organize your variable values more
easily. Included with the sample playbook is a sample variables
file `all.yml`_.

The value for the property **_BPXK_AUTOCVT** must be configured to ``ON``, for
example; ``_BPXK_AUTOCVT: "ON"``.

The value for the property **ZOAU_HOME** is the ZOA Utilities install root path;
for example, ``ZOAU_HOME: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"``.

The value for the property **PYTHONPATH** is the ZOA Utilities Python library
path; for example, ``PYTHONPATH: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/lib/"``.

The value for the property **LIBPATH** is both the path to the
**Python libraries** on the target and the **ZOA Utilities Python library**
path separated by colons ``:``; for example,
``LIBPATH: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/lib/:/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz/lib:/lib:/usr/lib:."``.

The value for the property **PATH** is the **ZOA utilities BIN path** and the
**Python BIN path**; for example,
``PATH: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/bin:/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz/bin:/bin"``.

The value for the property **_CEE_RUNOPTS** is the invocation Language
Environment® runtime options for programs and used by Python; for example;
``_CEE_RUNOPTS: "FILETAG(AUTOCVT,AUTOTAG) POSIX(ON)"``.

The value for properties **__TAG_REDIR_ERR**, **_TAG_REDIR_IN**,
**_TAG_REDIR_OUT** are ``txt`` and used by the shell; for example,

.. code-block:: sh

  _TAG_REDIR_ERR: "txt"
  _TAG_REDIR_IN: "txt"
  _TAG_REDIR_OUT: "txt"

The value for the property **LANG** is the name of the default locale; the value
**C** specifies the POSIX locale. For example, ``LANG: "C"``.

The included **all.yml** sample variables file contents are:

.. code-block:: yaml

   environment_vars:
     _BPXK_AUTOCVT: "ON"
     ZOAU_HOME: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"
     PYTHONPATH: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/lib"
     LIBPATH: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/lib/:/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz/lib:/usr/lib:/lib:."
     PATH: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil/bin:/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz/bin:/bin"
     _CEE_RUNOPTS: "FILETAG(AUTOCVT,AUTOTAG) POSIX(ON)"
     _TAG_REDIR_ERR: "txt"
     _TAG_REDIR_IN: "txt"
     _TAG_REDIR_OUT: "txt"
     LANG: "C"

.. note::
   In ZOAU 1.0.2 and later, the property **ZOAU_ROOT** is no longer supported
   and must be replaced with the property **ZOAU_HOME**. If you are using ZOAU
   version 1.0.1 or lower, you must continue to use the property
   **ZOAU_ROOT** which is the ZOA Utilities install root path required for
   ZOAU; for example, ``/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil``.

.. _all.yml:
   https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/blob/master/playbooks/group_vars/all.yml


A reusable approach to storing your group variables is to create top level
dependency variables and rely on variable expansion to substitute the values.
This is preferred, because it tends to reduce misconfiguration when copying
dependency paths. In this example, the top level dependency variables ``PYZ``
for Python and ``ZOAU`` have been added and used through the configuration.

.. code-block:: yaml

   PYZ: "/usr/lpp/IBM/cyp/v3r8/pyz"
   ZOAU: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"

   environment_vars:
     _BPXK_AUTOCVT: "ON"
     ZOAU_HOME: "{{ ZOAU }}"
     PYTHONPATH: "{{ ZOAU }}/lib"
     LIBPATH: "{{ ZOAU }}/lib:{{ PYZ }}/lib:/lib:/usr/lib:."
     PATH: "{{ ZOAU }}/bin:{{ PYZ }}/bin:/bin:/var/bin:/usr/lpp/java/J8.0/bin"
     _CEE_RUNOPTS: "FILETAG(AUTOCVT,AUTOTAG) POSIX(ON)"
     _TAG_REDIR_ERR: "txt"
     _TAG_REDIR_IN: "txt"
     _TAG_REDIR_OUT: "txt"
     LANG: "C"

.. note::

   Currently, IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS is the supported and
   recommended Python distribution for use on z/OS with Ansible and ZOAU. If
   Rocket Python is the only available python on the target, please review the
   suggested environment variables below for use with Rocket Python.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ########################################
   # Rocket suggested environment variables
   ########################################
   PYZ: "/usr/lpp/rsusr/python36"
   ZOAU: "/usr/lpp/IBM/zoautil"

   environment_vars:
     ZOAU_ROOT: "{{ ZOAU }}"
     ZOAU_HOME: "{{ ZOAU }}"
     PYTHONPATH: "{{ ZOAU }}/lib:{{ PYZ }}:/lib:/usr/lib"
     _BPXK_AUTOCVT: "ON"
     PATH: "{{ ZOAU }}/bin:/bin:/var/bin:{{ PYZ }}/bin"
     LIBPATH: "{{ ZOAU }}/lib:{{ PYZ }}/lib:/lib:/usr/lib:."

Run the playbook
----------------

Access the sample Ansible playbook and ensure that you are within the collection
playbooks directory where the sample files are included:
``~/.ansible/collections/ibm/ibm_zos_core/playbooks/``.

Use the Ansible command ``ansible-playbook`` to run the sample playbook.  The
command syntax is ``ansible-playbook -i <inventory> <playbook>``; for example,
``ansible-playbook -i inventory zos-collection-sample.yaml``.

This command assumes that the controller's public SSH key has been shared with
the managed node. If you want to avoid entering a username and password each
time, copy the SSH public key to the managed node using the ``ssh-copy-id``
command; for example, ``ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey.pub user@<hostname>``.

Alternatively, you can use the ``--ask-pass`` option to be prompted for the
user's password each time a playbook is run; for example,
``ansible-playbook -i inventory zos-collection-sample.yaml --ask-pass``.

.. note::
   * Using ``--ask-pass`` is not recommended because it will hinder performance.
   * Using ``--ask-pass`` requires ``sshpass`` be installed on the controller.
     For further reference, see the `ask-pass documentation`_.

Optionally, you can configure the console logging verbosity during playbook
execution. This is helpful in situations where communication is failing and
you want to obtain more details. To adjust the logging verbosity, append more
letter `v`'s; for example, `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`, or `-vvvv`. Each letter `v`
increases logging verbosity similar to traditional logging levels INFO, WARN,
ERROR, DEBUG.

.. note::
   It is a good practice to review the playbook samples before executing them.
   It will help you understand what requirements in terms of space, location,
   names, authority, and artifacts will be created and cleaned up. Although
   samples are always written to operate without the need for the user's
   configuration, flexibility is written into the samples because it is not
   easy to determine if a sample has access to the host's resources.
   Review the playbook notes sections for additional details and
   configuration.

   Sample playbooks often submit JCL that is included with this collection
   under the `files directory`_. Review the sample JCL for necessary edits to
   allow for submission on the target system. The most common changes are to
   add a CLASS parameter and change the NOTIFY user parameter. For more details,
   see the JCL notes section included in the collection.
