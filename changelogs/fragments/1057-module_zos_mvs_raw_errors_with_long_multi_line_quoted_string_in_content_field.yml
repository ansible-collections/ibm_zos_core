bugfixes:
  - zos_mvs_raw - module wasn't able to wrote properly a JCL with multi-line because truncated
    the first one or two characters writing an syntactically incorrect JCL.
    Change now validate the length of lines and allow multi-line declaration with | or |1-9 by added
    two spaces to be syntactically corrects.
