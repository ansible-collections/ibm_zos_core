    zos_copy - fixes a bug that when a directory is copied from the controller
    to the managed node and a mode is set, the mode is now applied to the
    directory on the controller. If the directory being copied contains files
    and mode is set, mode will only be applied to the files being copied not the
    pre-existing files.
    zos_copy - fixes a bug where options were not defined in the module
    argument spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` 2.11
    and using options `force` or `mode`.
    zos_fetch - fixes a bug where an option was not defined in the module
    argument spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` 2.11
    and using option `encoding`.
    zos_job_submit - fixes a bug where an option was not defined in the module
    argument spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` 2.11
    and using option `encoding`.
    jobs.py - fixes a utility used by module `zos_job_output` that would
    truncate the DD content, issue #354
    zos_ssh - fixes connection plugin which will error when using `ansible-core`
    2.11 with an `AttributeError: module 'ansible.constants' has no attribute
    'ANSIBLE_SSH_CONTROL_PATH_DIR'`, issue #495
