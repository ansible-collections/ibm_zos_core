bugfixes:
    - zos_copy was updated to correct deletion of all temporary files and
      unwarranted deletes.
        - When the module would complete, a cleanup routine did not take into
          account that other processes had open temporary files and thus would
          error when trying to remove them.
        - When the module would copy a directory (source) from USS to another
          USS directory (destination), any files currently in the destination
          would be deleted.
          The modules behavior has changed such that files are no longer deleted
          unless the force option is set to true. When **force=true**,
          copying files or a directory to a USS destination will continue if it
          encounters existing files or directories and overwrite any
          corresponding files.
    - zos_job_query was updated to correct a boolean condition that always
      evaluated to "CANCELLED".
        - When querying jobs that are either **CANCELLED** or have **FAILED**,
          they were always treated as **CANCELLED**.
