Managed node
============

The managed z/OS node is the host that is managed by Ansible, as identified in
the Ansible inventory.
The managed node has dependencies that are specific to each release of the
**IBM z/OS core collection**. Review the details of the dependencies before you
proceed to install the IBM z/OS core collection.

* `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_
* z/OS `V2R3`_ or `later`_
* `IBM Z Open Automation Utilities`_ (ZOAU)

   .. note::

     IBM z/OS core collection is dependent on specific versions of Z Open Automation
     Utilities (ZOAU). For information about the required version of ZOAU, review the
     `release notes`_. For detailed instructions on installation and configuration of ZOAU,
     `Installing and Configuring ZOA Utilities`_.

     
* `z/OS OpenSSH`_
* The `z/OS® shell`_

   .. note::
      Currently, only ``z/OS® shell`` is supported. Using
      ``ansible_shell_executable`` to change the default shell is discouraged.
      For more information, see `Ansible documentation`_. Shells such as ``bash``
      are not supported because they handle the reading and writing of untagged
      files differently. Please review the README.ZOS guide included with the
      ported ``bash`` shell for further configurations.

Python on z/OS
--------------

If the Ansible target is z/OS, you must install
**IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS** which is ported for the z/OS platform
and required by **IBM z/OS core collection**.

**Installation**

* Visit the `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_ product page for FMID,
  program directory, fix list, latest PTF, installation and configuration
  instructions.
* For reference, the Program IDs are:

  * 5655-PYT for the base product
  * 5655-PYS for service and support
* Optionally, download **IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS**, `here`_
* For the supported Python version, refer to the `release notes`_.

.. _here:
   https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/platform/mrs/assets?source=swg-ibmoep

.. note::

   Currently, IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS is the supported and
   recommended Python distribution for use with Ansible and ZOAU. If
   Rocket Python is the only available Python on the target, review the
   `recommended environment variables`_ for Rocket Python.

ZOAU
----

IBM Z Open Automation Utilities provide support for executing automation tasks
on z/OS. With ZOAU, you can run traditional MVS commands such as IEBCOPY,
IDCAMS, and IKJEFT01, as well as perform a number of data set operations
in the scripting language of your choice.

**Installation**

* Visit the `ZOAU`_ product page for the FMID, program directory, fix list,
  latest PTF, installation, and configuration instructions.
* For reference, the Program IDs are:

  * 5698-PA1 for the base product
  * 5698-PAS for service and support
