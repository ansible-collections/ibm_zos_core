short_description: Query job status
description:
  - List z/OS job(s) and the current status of the job(s).
  - Uses job_name to filter the jobs by the job name.
  - Uses job_id to filter the jobs by the job identifier.
  - Uses owner to filter the jobs by the job owner.
  - Uses system to filter the jobs by system where the job is running (or ran) on.

      - When a job id is greater than 99,999, the job id format will begin
        with `S`, `J`, `T` and are followed by 7 digits.
      - The I(job_id) can contain include multiple wildcards.
