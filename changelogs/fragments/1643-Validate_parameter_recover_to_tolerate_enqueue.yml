bugfixes:
  - zos_backup_restore - When a recoverable error was encountered and ``recover=True``,
    the module would ignore the option and fail. Fix now does not fail when a recoverable
    error is raised when ``recover=True``.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1643).
