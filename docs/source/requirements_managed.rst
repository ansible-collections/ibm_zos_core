Managed node
============

The managed z/OS node is the host that is managed by Ansible, as identified in
the Ansible inventory.
The managed node has dependencies that are specific to each release of the
**IBM z/OS core collection**. Review the details of the dependencies before you
proceed to install the IBM z/OS core collection.

* `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_
* z/OS `V2R3`_ or `later`_
* `IBM Z Open Automation Utilities`_ (ZOAU)

   * IBM z/OS core collection is dependent on specific versions of ZOAU.
     For information about the required version of ZOAU, review the
     `release notes`_.

* `z/OS OpenSSH`_
* The z/OS® shell

.. note::
   Currently, only ``z/OS® shell`` is supported. Using ``ansible_shell_executable`` to
   change the default shell is discouraged. For more information, see
   `Ansible documentation`_.

   Shells such as ``bash`` are not supported because they handle the reading and
   writing of untagged files differently. ``bash`` added enhanced ASCII support
   in version 4.3 and thus differs from 4.2. If ``bash`` shell is the only shell
   available, you must control how the new and existing files are tagged and encoded.
   This can be controlled by setting both "_ENCODE_FILE_NEW" and "_ENCODE_FILE_EXISTING".
   For example,

   * _ENCODE_FILE_NEW: "IBM-1047"
   * _ENCODE_FILE_EXISTING: "IBM-1047"

   Please review the README.ZOS guide included with the ported ``bash`` shell
   for further configurations.

Python on z/OS
--------------

If the Ansible target is z/OS, you must install
**IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS** which is ported for the z/OS platform
and required by **IBM z/OS core collection**.

**Installation**

* Visit the `IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS`_ product page for FMID,
  program directory, fix list, latest PTF, installation and configuration
  instructions.
* For reference, the Program IDs are:

  * 5655-PYT for the base product
  * 5655-PYS for service and support
* Optionally, download **IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS**, `here`_
* For the supported Python version, refer to the `release notes`_.

.. _here:
   https://www-01.ibm.com/marketing/iwm/platform/mrs/assets?source=swg-ibmoep

.. note::

   Currently, IBM Open Enterprise Python for z/OS is the supported and
   recommended Python distribution for use with Ansible and ZOAU. If
   Rocket Python is the only available Python on the target, review the
   `recommended environment variables`_ for Rocket Python.

.. _recommended environment variables:

ZOAU
----

IBM Z Open Automation Utilities provide support for executing automation tasks
on z/OS. With ZOAU, you can run traditional MVS commands such as IEBCOPY,
IDCAMS, and IKJEFT01, as well as perform a number of data set operations
in the scripting language of your choice.

**Installation**

* Visit the `ZOAU`_ product page for the FMID, program directory, fix list,
  latest PTF, installation, and configuration instructions.
* For reference, the Program IDs are:

  * 5698-PA1 for the base product
  * 5698-PAS for service and support
* For ZOAU supported version, refer to the `release notes`_.
