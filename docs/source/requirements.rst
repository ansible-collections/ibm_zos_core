Requirements
============

A control node is any machine with Ansible installed. From the control node,
you can run commands and playbooks from a laptop, desktop, or server.
However, you cannot run **IBM z/OS core collection** on a Windows system.

A managed node is often referred to as a target node, or host, and it is managed
by Ansible. Ansible need not be installed on a managed node, but SSH must be
enabled.

The nodes listed below require these specific versions of software:

Control node
------------

* `Ansible version`_: 2.9 or later
* `Python`_: 2.7 or later
* `OpenSSH`_

.. _Ansible version:
   https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html
.. _Python:

.. _OpenSSH:
   https://www.openssh.com/


Managed node
------------

* `Python on z/OS`_: 3.6 or later
* `z/OS`_: V02.02.00 or later
* `IBM Z Open Automation Utilities`_ (ZOAU)

   * IBM z/OS core collections are dependent on specific versions of ZOAU.
     For information about the required version of ZOAU, review the
     `release notes`_.
* `z/OS OpenSSH`_

Python on z/OS
--------------

If the Ansible target is z/OS, you must install a Python distribution ported
for this platform. Rocket Software is currently the preferred version for z/OS.

**Installation**

* Visit the `Rocket Software homepage`_ and create a required account in the
  `Rocket Customer Portal`_.
* Click Downloads on the top left portion the page.
* Select the category z/OpenSource on the left panel.
* Scroll and select Python.
* Download the binaries, installation files, and the README.ZOS onto an x86
  machine.
* Transfer the zipped tarball (tar.gz) file to the target z/OS system and
  extract it according to the instructions in the installation files.
* Follow the additional setup instructions as described in the README.ZOS file.
