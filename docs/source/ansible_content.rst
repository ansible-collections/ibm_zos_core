z/OS Core
=========

The **IBM z/OS core collection** is part of the Red Hat® *Ansible Certified Content
for IBM Z®* offering that brings Ansible automation to IBM Z®. This collection
brings forward the possibility to manage batch jobs, perform program authorizations,
run operator operations, and execute both JES and MVS commands as well as execute
shell, python, and REXX scripts. It supports data set creation, searching, copying,
fetching, and encoding. It provides both archive and unarchive of data sets,
initializing volumes, performing backups and supports Jinja templating.

System programmers can enable pipelines to setup, tear down and deploy applications
while system administrators can automate time consuming repetitive tasks inevitably
freeing up their time. New z/OS users can find comfort in Ansible's familiarity and
expedite their proficiency in record time.
