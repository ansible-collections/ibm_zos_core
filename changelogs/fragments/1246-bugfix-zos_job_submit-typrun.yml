bugfixes:
  - zos_job_submit - when typrun=scan was used in JCL, it would fail the module. Now
    typrun=scan no longer fails the module and an appropriate message is returned with
    appropriate return code values.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
  - zos_job_submit - when typrun=hold was used in JCL it would fail the module with an
    improper message and error condition. While this case continues to be considered
    a failure, the message has been corrected and it fails under the condition that
    not enough time has been added to the modules execution.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
  - zos_job_submit - when typrun=jchhold was used in JCL it would fail the module with an
    improper message and error condition. While this case continues to be considered
    a failure, the message has been corrected and it fails under the condition that
    not enough time has been added to the modules execution.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
  - zos_job_submit - when typrun=copy was used in JCL it would fail the module with an
    improper message and error condition. While this case continues to be considered
    a failure, the message has been corrected and it fails under the condition that
    not enough time has been added to the modules execution.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
  - zos_job_submit - when wait_time_s was used, the duration would run
    approximately 5 second longer than reported in the duration. Now the when
    duration is returned, it is the actual accounting from when the job is submitted
    to when the module reads the job output.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
  - zos_job_submit - when a response was returned, it contained an undocumented
    property; ret_code[msg_text]. Now when a response is returned, it correctly
    returns property ret_code[msg_txt].
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
  - zos_job_submit - when a JCL error occurred, the ret_code[msg_code] contained
    JCLERROR followed by an integer where the integer appeared to be a reason code
    when actually it is a multi line marker used to coordinate errors spanning more
    than one line. Now when a JCLERROR occurs, only the JCLERROR is returned for
    property ret_code[msg_code].
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
major_changes:
  - zos_job_submit - when job statuses were read, were limited to AC (active),
    CC (completed normally), ABEND (ended abnormally) and ? (error unknown),
    SEC (security error), JCLERROR (job had a jcl error). Now the additional statuses
    are supported, CANCELLED (job was cancelled), CAB (converter abend),
    CNV (converter error), SYS (system failure) and FLU (job was flushed).
