bugfixes:
  - zos_mvs_raw - If a program failed with a non-zero return code and verbose was false, the module would succeed (false positive).
    Fix now fails the module for all instances where a program has a non-zero return code.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1780).
  - zos_mvs_raw - Module would obfuscate the return code from the program when failing returning 8 instead.
    Fix now returns the proper return code from the program.
