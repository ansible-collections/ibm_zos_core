    A request object is the contract used by the services to fulfill an
    operation to the underlying connection class.

    Services will make requests to the connection methods. The
    connection methods will serve many different types of services and to avoid
    a complex type or specific args, the request class represents everything
    the connection class will need to do to fullfil the service request.

    Imagine we have file creation service as well as other types such as
    data set creation. If the service to create a file is called, it will
    review what has been requested, eg; file name, size, location, permissions,
    etc and generate a command and insert that into the request, there could be
    other fields added that would be helpful to the connection in the future.

    NOTE: I am considering to update the request to support multiple commands

    Response object is the contract returned by the services operations. It
    describes everything that is needed by the caller about the artifact created.

    The response object is a summary of everything it can provide such that the
    caller will not need to perform any additional queries, for example if a file
    is created, the response will contain every attribute known on the file, such
    as permissions bits and more.

    The response object is also used in the managing the objects lifecycle
    meaning that it cached and later can be retrieved with everything it needs
    to reestablish a connection and perform the resource allocation (destroy
    the artifact). There is no point on persisting connections as it would
    require a connetion pool and for a first iteration this model of recreating
    connection based on the response properties should suffice.
