bugfixes:
  - zos_copy - When a data set name had the maximum length of 44 characters, a check to see if it
    is an alias would fail. Fix now solves this issue so that any valid data set name can be used
    as a source or destination.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2391)
  - zos_backup_restore - Module documentation stated that default ``space_type`` for a backup was ``m`` but module would use bytes instead.
    Fix now uses the correct default space type.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2391).
trivial:
   - test_zos_zfs_resize_func.py - modified test case `test_grow_n_shrink_operations_trace_ds_not_created` and `test_grow_n_shrink_operations_trace_ds`
     to resolve issues when testing ansible 2.18.
