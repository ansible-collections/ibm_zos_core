Minor Changes
-------------

- zos_archive - Adds support for encoding before archiving files. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2081)
- zos_archive - Adds support for reverting the encoding of a source's files after archiving them. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2192)

- zos_mvs_raw  - Before this addition, you could not put anything in columns 1 or 2, were reserved for JCL processing. Change now allows add reserved_cols option and validate that the module get access to modify dd_content option base on the value, if not retain the previous behavior or work. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2086)
- zos_mvs_raw - Adds support for volume data definition. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2194)
- zos_stat - Added support to recall migrated data sets and return its attributes. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2075)

- zos_unarchive - Added encoding support for the unarchive module. This allows users to encode the files after unarchiving them in a perticular encoding. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2105)

Bugfixes
--------

- zos_backup_restore - Return value `backup_name` was empty upon successful result. Fix now returns `backup_name` populated. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2040).
- zos_data_set - Attempting to create a data set with the same name on a different volume did not work, nor did it report a failure. The fix now informs the user that if the data set is cataloged on a different volume, it needs to be uncataloged before using the data set module to create a new data set on a different volume. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2057).
- zos_fetch - Previously, the use of `become` would result in a permissions error while trying to fetch a data set or a member. Fix now allows a user to escalate privileges when fetching resources. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2079)
- zos_lineinfile - Return values ``return_content`` and ``backup_name`` were not always being returned. Fix now ensure that these values are always present in the module's response. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2120)
- zos_lineinfile - The module would report a false negative when certain special characters where present in the `line` option. Fix now reports the successful operation. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2080).
- zos_mount - FSUMF168 return in stderror means that the mount dataset wouldn't resolve. While this shows a catalog or volume issue, it should not impact our search for an existing mount. Added handling to the df call, so that FSUMF168 are ignored. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2060).

Minor Changes
-------------

- module_utils/import_handler - When importing a non supported ZOAU version like 1.2.x the module would throw a non user friendly error message. Error message is now explicit about ZOAU not being properly configured for Ansible. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1804).
- zos_copy - Added new option ``autoescape`` to ``template_parameters``, allowing users to disable autoescaping of common XML/HTML characters when working with Jinja templates. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1810).
- zos_copy - Adds error message when a PDS/E source member does not exist or is not cataloged. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1821).
- zos_job_submit - Add deploy and forget capability. Now when wait_time_s is 0, the module will submit the job and will not wait to get the job details or content, returning only the job id. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1746).
- zos_job_submit - Added new option ``autoescape`` to ``template_parameters``, allowing users to disable autoescaping of common XML/HTML characters when working with Jinja templates. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1810).

- zos_mvs_raw - Added ``max_rc`` option. Now when the user sets ``max_rc``, the module tolerates the failure if the return code is smaller than the ``max_rc`` specified, however, return value ``changed`` will be False if the program return code is not 0. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1813).
- zos_script - Added new option ``autoescape`` to ``template_parameters``, allowing users to disable autoescaping of common XML/HTML characters when working with Jinja templates. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1810).

Bugfixes
--------

- zos_copy - Improve module zos_copy error handling when the user does not have universal access authority set to UACC(READ) for SAF Profile 'MVS.MCSOPER.ZOAU' and SAF Class OPERCMDS. The module now handles the exception and returns an informative message. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1744).
- zos_copy - Previously, if the dataset name included special characters such as $, validation would fail when force_lock was false. This has been changed to allow the use of special characters when force_lock option is false. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1936)
- zos_copy - Previously, if the dataset name included special characters such as ``$`` and ``asa_text`` option is true, the module would fail. Fix now allows the use of special characters in the data set name when ``asa_text`` option is true. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1924).
- zos_copy - When ``asa_text`` was set to true at the same time as ``force_lock``, a copy would fail saying the destination was already in use. Fix now opens destination data sets up with disposition SHR when ``force_lock`` and ``asa_text`` are set to true. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1939).
- zos_fetch - Some relative paths were not accepted as a parameter e.g. C(files/fetched_file). Change now allows the user to use different types of relative paths as a parameter. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1769).
- zos_find - Module would not find VSAM data and index resource types. Fix now finds the data and index resource types. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1822).
- zos_find - Module would not find a VSAM cluster resource type if it was in use with DISP=OLD. Fix now finds the VSAM cluster. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1822).
- zos_job_query - Module was not returning values for system and subsystem. Fix now returns these values. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1759).
- zos_mvs_raw - If a program failed with a non-zero return code and verbose was false, the module would succeed. Whereas, if the program failed and verbose was true the module would fail. Fix now has a consistent behavior and fails in both cases. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1774).
- zos_mvs_raw - Module would not populate stderr return value. Fix now populates stderr in return values. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1808).
- zos_mvs_raw - Module would obfuscate the return code from the program when failing returning 8 instead. Fix now returns the proper return code from the program. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1774).
- zos_mvs_raw - Module would return the stderr content in stdout when verbose was true and return code was 0. Fix now does not replace stdout content with stderr. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1794).
- zos_mvs_raw - Option ``tmp_hlq`` was not being used as HLQ when creating backup data sets. Fix now uses ``tmp_hlq`` as HLQ for backup data sets. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1847).
- zos_script - When the user trying to run a remote script had execute permissions but wasn't owner of the file, the module would fail while trying to change permissions on it. Fix now ensures the module first checks if the user can execute the script and only try to change permissions when necessary. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1852).

Bugfixes
--------

- module_util/data_set.py - DataSet.data_set_cataloged function previously only returned True or False, but failed to account for exceptions which occurred during the LISTCAT. The fix now raises an MVSCmdExecError if the return code from LISTCAT is too high. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1535).
- zos_copy - a regression in version 1.4.0 made the module stop automatically computing member names when copying a single file into a PDS/E. Fix now lets a user copy a single file into a PDS/E without adding a member in the dest option. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1570).
- zos_copy - module would use opercmd to check if a non existent destination data set is locked. Fix now only checks if the destination is already present. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1623).
- zos_job_submit - Was not propagating any error types UnicodeDecodeError, JSONDecodeError, TypeError, KeyError when encountered, now the error message shares the type error. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1560).
- zos_mvs_raw - DD_output first character from each line was missing. Change now includes the first character of each line. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1543).

Bugfixes
--------

- module_utils/job.py - job output containing non-printable characters would crash modules. Fix now handles the error gracefully and returns a message to the user inside `content` of the `ddname` that failed. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1261).
- zos_apf - List option only returned one data set. Fix now returns the list of retrieved data sets. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1204).
- zos_blockinfile - Using double quotation marks inside a block resulted in a false positive result with ZOAU 1.3. Fix now handles this special case to avoid false negatives. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1340).
- zos_find - Filter size failed if a PDS/E matched the pattern. Fix now gets the correct size for PDS/Es. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1443).
- zos_job_submit - Was ignoring the default value for location=DATA_SET, now when location is not specified it will default to DATA_SET. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1220).
- zos_job_submit - when the argument max_rc was different than 0 the changed response returned as false. Fix now return a changed response as true when the rc is not 0 and max_rc is above or equal to the value of the job. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1345).
- zos_mvs_raw - The module ignored the value of `tmp_hlq` option when creating temporary data sets. Fix now honors the value if provided and uses it as High Level Qualifier for temporary data sets created during the module execution. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1320).

v1.9.0

Release Summary
---------------

Release Date: '2024-03-11'
This changelog describes all changes made to the modules and plugins included
in this collection. The release date is the date the changelog is created.
For additional details such as required dependencies and availability review
the collections `release notes <https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zos_core/docs/source/release_notes.html>`__

Major Changes
-------------

- zos_job_submit - when job statuses were read, were limited to AC (active), CC (completed normally), ABEND (ended abnormally) and ? (error unknown), SEC (security error), JCLERROR (job had a jcl error). Now the additional statuses are supported, CANCELLED (job was cancelled), CAB (converter abend), CNV (converter error), SYS (system failure) and FLU (job was flushed). (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).

Minor Changes
-------------

- zos_apf - Improves exception handling if there is a failure parsing the command response when operation selected is list. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1036).
- zos_copy - Improve zos_copy performance when copying multiple members from one PDS/E to another. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1176).
- zos_job_output - When passing a job ID and owner the module take as mutually exclusive. Change now allows the use of a job ID and owner at the same time. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1078).
- zos_job_submit - Improve error messages in zos_job_submit to be clearer. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1074).
- zos_job_submit - The module had undocumented parameter and uses as temporary file when the location of the file is LOCAL. Change now uses the same name as the src for the temporary file removing the addition of tmp_file to the arguments. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1091).
- zos_job_submit - The module handling ZOAU import errors obscured the original traceback when an import error ocurred. Fix now passes correctly the context to the user. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1091).
- zos_mvs_raw - when using the dd_input content option for instream-data, if the content was not properly indented according to the program which is generally a blank in columns 1 & 2, those columns would be truncated. Now, when setting instream-data, the module will ensure that all lines contain a blank in columns 1 and 2 and add blanks when not present while retaining a maximum length of 80 columns for any line. This is true for all content types; string, list of strings and when using a YAML block indicator. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1057). - zos_mvs_raw - no examples were included with the module that demonstrated using a YAML block indicator, this now includes examples using a YAML block indicator.
- zos_tso_command - add example for executing explicitly a REXX script from a data set. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1065).

Bugfixes
--------

- module_utils/job.py - job output containing non-printable characters would crash modules. Fix now handles the error gracefully and returns a message to the user inside `content` of the `ddname` that failed. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1288).
- zos_apf - When operation=list was selected and more than one data set entry was fetched, the module only returned one data set. Fix now returns the complete list. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1236).
- zos_copy - When copying an executable data set with aliases and destination did not exist, destination data set was created with wrong attributes. Fix now creates destination data set with the same attributes as the source. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1066).
- zos_copy - When performing a copy operation to an existing file, the copied file resulted in having corrupted contents. Fix now implements a workaround to not use the specific copy routine that corrupts the file contents. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1064).
- zos_data_set - Fixes a small parsing bug in module_utils/data_set function which extracts volume serial(s) from a LISTCAT command output. Previously a leading '-' was left behind for volser strings under 6 chars. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1247).
- zos_job_output - When passing a job ID or name less than 8 characters long, the module sent the full stack trace as the module's message. Change now allows the use of a shorter job ID or name, as well as wildcards. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1078).
- zos_job_query - The module handling ZOAU import errors obscured the original traceback when an import error ocurred. Fix now passes correctly the context to the user. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1042).
- zos_job_query - When passing a job ID or name less than 8 characters long, the module sent the full stack trace as the module's message. Change now allows the use of a shorter job ID or name, as well as wildcards. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1078).
- zos_job_submit - Was ignoring the default value for location=DATA_SET, now when location is not specified it will default to DATA_SET. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1120).
- zos_job_submit - when a JCL error occurred, the ret_code[msg_code] contained JCLERROR followed by an integer where the integer appeared to be a reason code when actually it is a multi line marker used to coordinate errors spanning more than one line. Now when a JCLERROR occurs, only the JCLERROR is returned for property ret_code[msg_code]. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
- zos_job_submit - when a response was returned, it contained an undocumented property; ret_code[msg_text]. Now when a response is returned, it correctly returns property ret_code[msg_txt]. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
- zos_job_submit - when typrun=copy was used in JCL it would fail the module with an improper message and error condition. While this case continues to be considered a failure, the message has been corrected and it fails under the condition that not enough time has been added to the modules execution. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
- zos_job_submit - when typrun=hold was used in JCL it would fail the module with an improper message and error condition. While this case continues to be considered a failure, the message has been corrected and it fails under the condition that not enough time has been added to the modules execution. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
- zos_job_submit - when typrun=jchhold was used in JCL it would fail the module with an improper message and error condition. While this case continues to be considered a failure, the message has been corrected and it fails under the condition that not enough time has been added to the modules execution. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
- zos_job_submit - when typrun=scan was used in JCL, it would fail the module. Now typrun=scan no longer fails the module and an appropriate message is returned with appropriate return code values. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
- zos_job_submit - when wait_time_s was used, the duration would run approximately 5 second longer than reported in the duration. Now the when duration is returned, it is the actual accounting from when the job is submitted to when the module reads the job output. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1283).
- zos_operator - The module handling ZOAU import errors obscured the original traceback when an import error ocurred. Fix now passes correctly the context to the user. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1042).
- zos_unarchive - Using a local file with a USS format option failed when sending to remote because dest_data_set option had an empty dictionary. Fix now leaves dest_data_set as None when using a USS format option. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1045).
- zos_unarchive - When unarchiving USS files, the module left temporary files on the remote. Change now removes temporary files. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1073).

Minor Changes
-------------

- module_utils/template - Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path traversals. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1029)
- zos_archive - Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path traversals. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1029)

- zos_copy -  Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path traversals. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/962)
- zos_copy - Add new option `force_lock` that can copy into data sets that are already in use by other processes (DISP=SHR). User needs to use with caution because this is subject to race conditions and can lead to data loss. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/980).
- zos_copy - includes a new option `executable` that enables copying of executables such as load modules or program objects to both USS and partitioned data sets. When the `dest` option contains a non-existent data set, `zos_copy` will create a data set with the appropriate attributes for an executable. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/804)
- zos_copy - introduces a new option 'aliases' to enable preservation of member aliases when copying data to partitioned data sets (PDS) destinations from USS or other PDS sources. Copying aliases of text based members to/from USS is not supported. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1014)
- zos_fetch - Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path traversals. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/962)
- zos_job_submit - Change action plugin call from copy to zos_copy. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/951)
- zos_job_submit - Previous code did not return output, but still requested job data from the target system. This changes to honor return_output=false by not querying the job dd segments at all. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1063).
- zos_operator - Changed system to call 'wait=true' parameter to zoau call. Requires zoau 1.2.5 or later. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/976)
- zos_operator_action_query - Add a max delay of 5 seconds on each part of the operator_action_query. Requires zoau 1.2.5 or later. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/976)
- zos_script - Add support for remote_tmp from the Ansible configuration to setup where temporary files will be created, replacing the module option tmp_path. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1068).
- zos_tso_command - Add example for executing explicitly a REXX script from a data set. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1072).
- zos_unarchive -  Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path traversals. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1029)
- zos_unarchive - Enhanced test cases to use test lines the same length of the record length. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/965)

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- zos_blockinfile debug - is deprecated in favor of 'as_json' (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/904).

Bugfixes
--------

- zos_copy - Update option limit to include LIBRARY as dest_dataset/suboption value. Documentation updated to reflect this change. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/968).
- zos_copy - When copying an executable data set from controller to managed node, copy operation failed with an encoding error. Fix now avoids encoding when executable option is selected. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1079).
- zos_copy - When copying an executable data set with aliases and destination did not exist, destination data set was created with wrong attributes. Fix now creates destination data set with the same attributes as the source. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1067).
- zos_copy - When performing a copy operation to an existing file, the copied file resulted in having corrupted contents. Fix now implements a workaround to not use the specific copy routine that corrupts the file contents. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1069).
- zos_job_submit - Temporary files were created in tmp directory. Fix now ensures the deletion of files every time the module run. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/951)
- zos_job_submit - The last line of the jcl was missing in the input. Fix now ensures the presence of the full input in job_submit. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/952)
- zos_lineinfile - A duplicate entry was made even if line was already present in the target file. Fix now prevents a duplicate entry if the line already exists in the target file. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/916)
- zos_operator - The last line of the operator was missing in the response of the module. The fix now ensures the presence of the full output of the operator. https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/918)
- zos_operator - The module was ignoring the wait time argument. The module now passes the wait time argument to ZOAU. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1063).
- zos_operator_action_query - The module was ignoring the wait time argument. The module now passes the wait time argument to ZOAU. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1063).
- zos_unarchive - When zos_unarchive fails during unpack either with xmit or terse it does not clean the temporary data sets created. Fix now removes the temporary data sets. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1054).

Known Issues
------------

- Several modules have reported UTF8 decoding errors when interacting with results that contain non-printable UTF8 characters in the response. This occurs when a module receives content that does not correspond to a UTF-8 value. These include modules `zos_job_submit`, `zos_job_output`, `zos_operator_action_query` but are not limited to this list. This will be addressed in `ibm_zos_core` version 1.10.0-beta.1. Each case is unique, some options to work around the error are below. - Specify that the ASA assembler option be enabled to instruct the assembler to use ANSI control characters instead of machine code control characters. - Add `ignore_errors:true` to the playbook task so the task error will not fail the playbook. - If the error is resulting from a batch job, add `ignore_errors:true` to the task and capture the output into a variable and extract the job ID with a regular expression and then use `zos_job_output` to display the DD without the non-printable character such as the DD `JESMSGLG`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/677) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/776) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/972)
- With later versions of `ansible-core` used with `ibm_zos_core` collection a warning has started to appear "Module "ansible.builtin.command" returned non UTF-8 data in the JSON response" that is currently being reviewed. There are no recommendations at this point. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/983)

the collections `release notes <https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zos_core/docs/source/release_notes.html>`__

Major Changes
-------------

- zos_copy - Previously, backups were taken when force was set to false; whether or not a user specified this operation which caused allocation issues with space and permissions. This removes the automatic backup performed and reverts to the original logic in that backups must be initiated by the user. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/896)

Minor Changes
-------------

- Add support for Jinja2 templates in zos_copy and zos_job_submit when using local source files. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/667)
- zos_archive - If destination data set space is not provided then the module computes it based on the src list and/or expanded src list based on pattern provided. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/930).
- zos_archive - When xmit faces a space error in xmit operation because of dest or log data set are filled raises an appropriate error hint. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/930).
- zos_copy - Adds block_size, record_format, record_length, space_primary, space_secondary, space_type and type in the return output when the destination data set does not exist and has to be created by the module. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/773)
- zos_data_set - record format = 'F' has been added to support 'fixed' block records. This allows records that can use the entire block. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/821)
- zos_job_output - zoau added 'program_name' to their field output starting with v1.2.4.  This enhancement checks for that version and passes the extra column through. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/841)
- zos_job_query - Adds new fields job_class, svc_class, priority, asid, creation_datetime, and queue_position to the return output when querying or submitting a job. Available when using ZOAU v1.2.3 or greater. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/778)
- zos_job_query - unnecessary calls were made to find a jobs DDs that incurred unnecessary overhead. This change removes those resulting in a performance increase in job related queries. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/911)
- zos_job_query - zoau added 'program_name' to their field output starting with v1.2.4.  This enhancement checks for that version and passes the extra column through. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/841)
- zos_job_submit - zoau added 'program_name' to their field output starting with v1.2.4.  This enhancement checks for that version and passes the extra column through. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/841)
- zos_unarchive - When copying to remote fails now a proper error message is displayed. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/930).
- zos_unarchive - When copying to remote if space_primary is not defined, then is defaulted to 5M. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/930).

Bugfixes
--------

- module_utils - data_set.py - Reported a failure caused when cataloging a VSAM data set. Fix now corrects how VSAM data sets are cataloged. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/791).
- zos_archive - Module did not return the proper src state after archiving. Fix now displays the status of the src after the operation. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/930).
- zos_blockinfile - Test case generate a data set that was not correctly removed. Changes delete the correct data set not only member. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/840)
- zos_copy - Module returned the dynamic values created with the same dataset type and record format. Fix validate the correct dataset type and record format of target created. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/824)
- zos_copy - Reported a false positive such that the response would have `changed=true` when copying from a source (src) or destination (dest) data set that was in use (DISP=SHR). This change now displays an appropriate error message and returns `changed=false`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/794).
- zos_copy - Reported a warning about the use of _play_context.verbosity.This change corrects the module action to prevent the warning message. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/806).
- zos_copy - Test case for recursive encoding directories reported a UTF-8 failure. This change ensures proper test coverage for nested directories and file permissions. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/806).
- zos_copy - Zos_copy did not encode inner content inside subdirectories once the source was copied to the destination. Fix now encodes all content in a source directory, including subdirectories. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/772).
- zos_copy - kept permissions on target directory when copy overwrote files. The fix now set permissions when mode is given. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/795)
- zos_data_set - Reported a failure caused when `present=absent` for a VSAM data set leaving behind cluster components. Fix introduces a new logical flow that will evaluate the volumes, compare it to the provided value and if necessary catalog and delete. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/791).
- zos_fetch - Reported a warning about the use of _play_context.verbosity.This change corrects the module action to prevent the warning message. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/806).
- zos_job_output - Error message did not specify the job not found. Fix now specifies the job_id or job_name being searched to ensure more information is given back to the user. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/747)
- zos_operator - Reported a failure caused by unrelated error response. Fix now gives a transparent response of the operator to avoid false negatives. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/762).

Major Changes
-------------

- zos_volume_init - Introduces new module to handle volume (or minidisk) initialization. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/654)

Minor Changes
-------------

- Updated the text converter import from "from ansible.module_utils._text" to "from ansible.module_utils.common.text.converters" to remove warning".. warn Use ansible.module_utils.common.text.converters instead.". (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/602)
- module_utils - job.py utility did not support positional wiled card placement, this enhancement uses `fnmatch` logic to support wild cards.
- zos_copy - Fixed a bug where the module would change the mode for a directory when copying into it the contents of another. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/723)
- zos_copy - was enhanced to keep track of modified members in a destination dataset, restoring them to their previous state in case of a failure. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/551)
- zos_data_set - add force parameter to enable member delete while pdse is in use (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/718).
- zos_job_query - ansible module does not support positional wild card placement for `job_name1 or `job_id`. This enhancement allows embedded wildcards throughout the `job_name` and `job_id`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/721)
- zos_lineinfile - would access data sets with exclusive access so no other task can read the data, this enhancement allows for a data set to be opened with a disposition set to share so that other tasks can access the data when option `force` is set to `true`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/731)
- zos_tso_command - was enhanced to accept `max_rc` as an option. This option allows a non-zero return code to succeed as a valid return code. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/666)

Bugfixes
--------

- Fixed wrong error message when a USS source is not found, aligning with a similar error message from zos_blockinfile "{src} does not exist".

the collections `release notes <https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zos_core/docs/source/release_notes.html>`__

Major Changes
-------------

- ibm_zos_core - Updates the entire collection in that the collection no longer depends on the managed node having installed System Display and Search Facility (SDSF). Remove SDSF dependency from ibm_zos_core collection. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/303).

Minor Changes
-------------

- module utility jobs - was updated to remove the usage of REXX and replaced with ZOAU python APIs. This reduces code replication and it removes the need for REXX interpretation which increases performance. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
- module utils backup - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- module utils dd_statement- updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- module utils encode - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_apf - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_blockinfile - fixes a bug when using double quotes in the block text of the module. When double quotes appeared in block text, the module would error differently depending on the usage of option insertafter. Examples of this error have return code 1 or 16 along with message "ZOAU dmod return content is NOT in json format" and a varying stderr. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/303).
- zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named force. This allows for a user to specify that the data set can be shared with others during an update which results in the data set you are updating to be simultaneously updated by others. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/316).
- zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named indentation. This allows for a user to specify a number of spaces to prepend to the content before being inserted into the destination. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/317).
- zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_copy - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_data_set - Ensures that temporary datasets created by zos_data_set use the tmp_hlq specified. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/491).
- zos_encode - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_fetch - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_gather_facts - is a new module that can discover facts about the managed z/OS target. This module leverages the zinfo utility offered by ZOAU. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/322).
- zos_job_output - was updated to leverage the latest changes that removes the REXX code by calling the module utility jobs. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
- zos_job_query - was updated to leverage the latest changes that removes the REXX code by calling the module utility jobs. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
- zos_job_query - was updated to use the jobs module utility. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
- zos_job_submit - The architecture changed such that the entire modules execution time now captured in the duration time which includes job submission and log collection. If a job does not return by the default 10 sec 'wait_time_s' value, it can be increased up to 86400 seconds. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_job_submit - behavior changed when a volume is defined in the module options such that it will catalog the data set if it is not cataloged and submit the job. In the past, the function did not catalog the data set and instead performed I/O operations and then submitted the job. This behavior aligns to other module behaviors and reduces the possibility to encounter a permissions issue. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_job_submit - was updated to include an additional error code condition JCLERR. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312)
- zos_lineinfile - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_mount - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_mvs_raw - Ensures that temporary datasets created by DD Statements use the tmp_hlq specified. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/414).
- zos_mvs_raw - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
- zos_operator - added in the response the cmd result (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_operator - added in the response the elapsed time (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_operator - added in the response the wait_time_s set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_operator - deprecated the wait option, not needed with wait_time_s minor_changes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_operator - was updated to remove the usage of REXX and replaced with ZOAU python APIs. This reduces code replication and it removes the need for REXX interpretation which increases performance. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- zos_encode - deprecates the module options `from_encoding` and `to_encoding` to use suboptions `from` and `to` in order to remain consistent with all other modules. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/345).
- zos_job_submit - Response 'message' property has been deprecated, all responses are now in response property 'msg'. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_job_submit - The 'wait' option has been deprecated because using option 'wait_time_s' implies the job is going to wait. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).

Bugfixes
--------

- zos_copy - Copy failed from a loadlib member to another loadlib member. Fix now looks for error in stdout in the if statement to use -X option. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/641)
- zos_copy - Fixed a bug where the module would change the mode for a directory when copying into it the contents of another. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/746)
- zos_copy - Fixes a bug such that the module fails when copying files from a directory needing also to be encoded. The failure would also delete the `src` which was not desirable behavior. Fixes deletion of src on encoding error. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/321).
- zos_copy - Fixes a bug where copying a member from a loadlib to another loadlib fails. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/640)
- zos_copy - Fixes a bug where files not encoded in IBM-1047 would trigger an error while computing the record length for a new destination dataset. Issue 664. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/725)
- zos_copy - Fixes a bug where if a destination has accented characters in its content, the module would fail when trying to determine if it is empty. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/634)
- zos_copy - Fixes a bug where the code for fixing an issue with newlines in files (issue 599) would use the wrong encoding for normalization. Issue 678. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/725)
- zos_copy - Fixes a bug where the computed record length for a new destination dataset would include newline characters. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/620)
- zos_copy - Fixes wrongful creation of destination backups when module option `force` is true, creating emergency backups meant to restore the system to its initial state in case of a module failure only when force is false. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/590)
- zos_copy - module was updated to correct a bug in the case when the destination (dest) is a PDSE and the source (src) is a Unix Systems File (USS). The module would fail in determining if the PDSE actually existed and try to create it when it already existed resulting in an error that would prevent the module from correctly executing. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/327)
- zos_data_set - Fixes a bug such that the module will delete a catalogued data set over an uncatalogued data set even though the volume is provided for the uncataloged data set. This is unexpected behavior and does not align to documentation; correct behavior is that when a volume is provided that is the first place the module should look for the data set, whether or not it is cataloged. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/325).
- zos_data_set - Fixes a bug where the default record format FB was actually never enforced and when enforced it would cause VSAM creation to fail with a Dynalloc failure. Also cleans up some of the options that are set by default when they have no bearing for batch. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/647)
- zos_fetch - Updates the modules behavior when fetching VSAM data sets such that the maximum record length is now determined when creating a temporary data set to copy the VSAM data into and a variable-length (VB) data set is used. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/350)
- zos_job_output - Fixes a bug that returned all ddname's when a specific ddnamae was provided. Now a specific ddname can be returned and all others ignored. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/334)
- zos_job_query - was updated to correct a boolean condition that always evaluated to "CANCELLED". (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
- zos_job_submit - Fixes the issue when `wait_time_s` was set to 0 that would result in a `type` error that a stack trace would result in the response, issue 670. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/683)
- zos_job_submit - Fixes the issue when a job encounters a security exception no job log would would result in the response, issue 684. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/683)
- zos_job_submit - Fixes the issue when a job is configured for a syntax check using TYPRUN=SCAN that it would wait the full duration set by `wait_time_s` to return a response, issue 685. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/683)
- zos_job_submit - Fixes the issue when a job is configured for a syntax check using TYPRUN=SCAN that no job log would result in the response, issue 685. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/683)
- zos_job_submit - Fixes the issue when a job is purged by the system that a stack trace would result in the response, issue 681. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/683)
- zos_job_submit - Fixes the issue when invalid JCL syntax is submitted that a stack trace would result in the response, issue 623. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/683)
- zos_job_submit - Fixes the issue when resources (data sets) identified in JCL did not exist such that a stack trace would result in the response, issue 624. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/683)
- zos_job_submit - Fixes the issue where the response did not include the job log when a non-zero return code would occur, issue 655. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/683)
- zos_mount - Fixes option `tag_ccsid` to correctly allow for type int. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/511)
- zos_mvs_raw - module was updated to correct a bug when no DD statements were provided. The module when no option was provided for `dds` would error, a default was provided to correct this behavior. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/336)
- zos_operator - Fixes case sensitive error checks, invalid, error & unidentifiable (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).

Release Summary
---------------

Release Date: '2022-12-07'
This changelog describes all changes made to the modules and plugins included
in this collection. The release date is the date the changelog is created.
For additional details such as required dependencies and availability review
the collections `release notes <https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zos_core/docs/source/release_notes.html>`__

Major Changes
-------------

- zos_copy was updated to support the ansible.builtin.ssh connection options; for further reference refer to the SSH plugin documentation.
- zos_copy was updated to take into account the record length when the source is a USS file and the destination is a data set with a record length. This is done by inspecting the destination data set attributes and using these attributes to create a new data set.
- zos_copy was updated with the capabilities to define destination data sets from within the zos_copy module. In the case where you are copying to a data set destination that does not exist, you can now do so using the new zos_copy module option destination.
- zos_fetch was updated to support the ansible.builtin.ssh connection options; for further reference refer to the SSH plugin documentation.
- zos_job_output was updated to to include the completion code (CC) for each individual job step as part of the ret_code response.
- zos_job_query was updated to handle when an invalid job ID or job name is used with the module and returns a proper response.
- zos_job_query was updated to support a 7 digit job number ID for when there are greater than 99,999 jobs in the history.
- zos_job_submit was enhanced to check for 'JCL ERROR' when jobs are submitted and result in a proper module response.
- zos_job_submit was updated to fail fast when a submitted job fails instead of waiting a predetermined time.
- zos_operator_action_query response messages were improved with more diagnostic information in the event an error is encountered.
- zos_ping was updated to remove the need for the zos_ssh connection plugin dependency.

Minor Changes
-------------

- zos_copy - enhanced the force option when `force=true` and the remote file or data set `dest` is NOT empty, the `dest` will be deleted and recreated with the `src` data set attributes, otherwise it will be recreated with the `dest` data set attributes. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
- zos_copy - enhanced to optimize how it captures the permission bits state for the `dest`. This change now reviews the source files instead of traversing the entire `dest` path. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/561)
- zos_copy - enhanced to support creating a parent directory when it does not exist in the `dest` path. Prior to this change, if a parent directory anywhere in the path did not exist the task would fail as it was stated in documentation. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/561)
- zos_copy - enhanced to support system symbols in PARMLIB. System symbols are elements that allow different z/OS® systems to share PARMLIB definitions while retaining unique values in those definitions. This was fixed in a future release through the use of one of the ZOAU dependency but this version of `ibm_zos_core` does not support that dependency version so this support was added. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/566)
- zos_copy - fixes a bug that when a directory is copied from the controller to the managed node and a mode is set, the mode is applied to the directory on the managed node. If the directory being copied contains files and mode is set, mode will only be applied to the files being copied not the pre-existing files. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
- zos_copy - fixes a bug where options were not defined in the module argument spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` v2.11 and using options `force` or `mode`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/496)
- zos_copy - introduced an updated creation policy referred to as precedence rules such that if `dest_data_set` is set, this will take precedence. If `dest` is an empty data set, the empty data set will be written with the expectation its attributes satisfy the copy. If no precedent rule has been exercised, `dest` will be created with the same attributes of `src`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
- zos_copy - introduced new computation capabilities such that if `dest` is a nonexistent data set, the attributes assigned will depend on the type of `src`. If `src` is a USS file, `dest` will have a Fixed Block (FB) record format and the remaining attributes will be computed. If `src` is binary, `dest` will have a Fixed Block (FB) record format with a record length of 80, block size of 32760, and the remaining attributes will be computed. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
- zos_copy - option `dest_dataset` has been deprecated and removed in favor of the new option `dest_data_set`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
- zos_copy - was enhanced for when `src` is a directory and ends with "/", the contents of it will be copied into the root of `dest`. It it doesn't end with "/", the directory itself will be copied. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/496)

Deprecated Features
-------------------

- zos_copy and zos_fetch option sftp_port has been deprecated. To set the SFTP port, use the supported options in the ansible.builtin.ssh plugin. Refer to the `SSH port <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ssh_connection.html#parameter-port>`__ option to configure the port used during the modules SFTP transport.
- zos_copy module option model_ds has been removed. The model_ds logic is now automatically managed and data sets are either created based on the src data set or overridden by the new option destination_dataset.
- zos_ssh connection plugin has been removed, it is no longer required. You must remove all playbook references to connection ibm.ibm_zos_core.zos_ssh.

Bugfixes
--------

- zos_copy - fixes a bug that did not create a data set on the specified volume. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
- zos_copy - fixes a bug where a number of attributes were not an option when using `dest_data_set`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
- zos_job_output - fixes a bug that returned all ddname's when a specific ddname was provided. Now a specific ddname can be returned and all others ignored. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/507)
- zos_job_output was updated to correct possible truncated responses for the ddname content. This would occur for jobs with very large amounts of content from a ddname.
- zos_mount - fixed option `tag_ccsid` to correctly allow for type int. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/502)
- zos_operator - enhanced to allow for MVS operator `SET` command, `SET` is equivalent to the abbreviated `T` command. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/501)
- zos_ssh - connection plugin was updated to correct a bug in Ansible that
    would result in playbook task retries overriding the SSH connection
    retries. This is resolved by renaming the zos_ssh option
    retries to reconnection_retries. The update addresses users of
    ansible-core v2.9 which continues to use retries and users of
    ansible-core v2.11 or later which uses reconnection_retries.
    This also resolves a bug in the connection that referenced a deprecated
    constant. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/328)

New Modules
-----------

- ibm.ibm_zos_core.zos_mount - Mount a z/OS file system.

the collections `release notes <https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zos_core/docs/source/release_notes.html>`__ 

Bugfixes
--------

- zos_copy was updated to correct deletion of all temporary files and unwarranted deletes. - When the module would complete, a cleanup routine did not take into account that other processes had open temporary files and thus would error when trying to remove them. - When the module would copy a directory (source) from USS to another USS directory (destination), any files currently in the destination would be deleted. The modules behavior has changed such that files are no longer deleted unless the force option is set to true. When **force=true**, copying files or a directory to a USS destination will continue if it encounters existing files or directories and overwrite any corresponding files.
- zos_job_query was updated to correct a boolean condition that always evaluated to "CANCELLED". - When querying jobs that are either **CANCELLED** or have **FAILED**, they were always treated as **CANCELLED**.
