trivial:
- zos_data_set - when a member is created by the module, the format is type
  data which is not suitable for executables. This change describes the
  format used when creating member.

bugfixes:
- zos_data_set - Reported a failure caused when `present=absent` for a VSAM
  data set leaving behind cluster components. Fix introduces a new logical
  flow that will evaluate the volumes, compare it to the provided value and
  if necessary catalog and delete.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/791).
- module_utils - data_set.py - Reported a failure caused when cataloging a
  VSAM data set. Fix now corrects how VSAM data sets are cataloged.
