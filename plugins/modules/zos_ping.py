module: zos_ping
version_added: "1.1.0"
short_description: Ping z/OS and check dependencies.
description:
  - L(zos_ping,./zos_ping.html) verifies the presence of z/OS Web Client Enablement Toolkit,
    iconv, and Python.
  - L(zos_ping,./zos_ping.html) returns C(pong) when the target host is not missing any required
    dependencies.
  - If the target host is missing optional dependencies, the L(zos_ping,./zos_ping.html) will
    return one or more warning messages.
  - If a required dependency is missing from the target host, an explanatory
    message will be returned with the module failure.

notes:
    - This module is written in REXX and relies on the SCP protocol to transfer the source to
      the managed z/OS node and encode it in the managed nodes default encoding, eg IBM-1047.
      Starting with OpenSSH 9.0, it switches from SCP to use SFTP by default, meaning transfers
      are no longer treated as text and are transferred as binary preserving the source files
      encoding resulting in a module failure. If you are using OpenSSH 9.0 (ssh -V) or later,
      you can instruct SSH to use SCP by adding the entry C(scp_extra_args="-O") into the ini
      file named C(ansible.cfg).
