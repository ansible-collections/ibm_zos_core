# Description
# Support for this feature was first added in ansible-core 2.12 so that
# ansible-test configured with desirable changes. This is an optional
# configuration, but when used, must be placed in "tests/config.yml"
# relative to the base of the collection. This configuration only
# applies to modules and module_utils.
#
# See additional example -
#  https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/test/lib/ansible_test/config/config.yml
#
# Options
# modules         - required
# python_requires - required
#   - 'default'   - All Python versions supported by Ansible.
#                   This is the default value if no configuration is provided.
# - 'controller'  - All Python versions supported by the Ansible controller.
#                   This indicates the modules/module_utils can only run on the controller.
#                   Intended for use only with modules/module_utils that depend on
#                   ansible-connection, which only runs on the controller.
#                   Unit tests for modules/module_utils will be permitted to import any
#                   Ansible code, instead of only module_utils.
# - SpecifierSet  - A PEP 440 specifier set indicating the supported Python versions.
#                   This is only needed when modules/module_utils do not support all
#                   Python versions supported by Ansible. It is not necessary to exclude
#                   versions which Ansible does not support, as this will be done automatically.
