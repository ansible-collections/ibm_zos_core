IBM z/OS core collection
========================

The **IBM z/OS core collection**, also represented as
**ibm_zos_core** in this document, is  part of the broader
initiative to bring Ansible Automation to IBM Z® through the offering
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®**. The
**IBM z/OS core collection** supports automation tasks such as
creating data sets, submitting jobs, querying jobs,
retrieving job output, encoding data sets, fetching data sets, copying data
sets, executing operator commands, executing TSO commands, ping,
querying operator actions, APF authorizing libraries,
editing textual data in data sets or Unix System Services files,
finding data sets, backing up and restoring data sets and
volumes and running z/OS programs without JCL.


Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z
===========================================

**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** provides the ability to
connect IBM Z® to clients' wider enterprise automation strategy through the
Ansible Automation Platform ecosystem. This enables development and operations
automation on Z through a seamless, unified workflow orchestration with
configuration management, provisioning, and application deployment in
one easy-to-use platform.

The **IBM z/OS core collection** is following the
**Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z®** method of distributing
content. Collections will be developed in the open, and when content is ready
for use it is released to
[Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/search?keywords=zos_&order_by=-relevance&deprecated=false&type=collection&page=1)
for community adoption. Once contributors review community usage, feedback,
and are satisfied with the content published, the collection will then be
released to [Ansible Automation Hub](https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-hub)
as **certified** and **IBM supported** for
**Red Hat® Ansible Automation Platform subscribers**.
