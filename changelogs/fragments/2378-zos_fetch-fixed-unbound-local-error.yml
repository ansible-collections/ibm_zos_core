bugfixes:
  - zos_fetch - Previously, running the module with a missing source could raise an ``UnboundLocalError``
    because the variable ``is_member`` was referenced before initialization. The fix now ensures
    ``is_member`` is initialized before dataset existence checks, allowing the module to fail gracefully
    with a proper error message when the source does not exist.
