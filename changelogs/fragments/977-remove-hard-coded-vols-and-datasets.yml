trivial:
  - zos_apf - Test suite was hard to follow. Change made easy to follow.
  - zos_archive - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
  - zos_backup_restore - Remove hard coded volumes in test.
  - zos_blockinfile - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
  - zos_copy - Remove hard coded volumes in test.
  - zos_data_set - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
  - zos_encode - Ensure atomicity of test cases and remove hard coded content.
  - zos_fetch - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
  - zos_find - Remove hard coded volumes in test.
  - zos_job_query - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
  - zos_job_submit - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
  - zos_lineinfile - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.

    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
  - zos_tso_command - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
  - zos_unarchive - Remove hard coded volumes and datasets names in test.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
    Now tests will generate random data set names and will use an available
    volume taken from a volume handler class, removing system specific
    name dependencies.
