  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Action plugin zos_copy was updated to support Python 2.7.
      - Job utility is an internal library used by several modules. It has been updated
        to use a custom written parsing routine capable of handling special characters
        to prevent job related reading operations from failing when a special character
        is encountered.
      - Module zos_copy was updated to fail gracefully when a it encounters a non-zero
        return code.
      - Module zos_copy was updated to support copying data set members that are program
        objects to a PDSE. Prior to this update, copying data set members would yield
        an error; - FSUM8976 Error writing <src_data_set_member> to PDSE member <dest_data_set_member>
      - Module zos_job_submit referenced a non-existent option and was corrected to
        **wait_time_s**.
      - Module zos_job_submit was updated to remove all trailing **\r** from jobs
        that are submitted from the controller.
      - Module zos_tso_command support was added for when the command output contained
        special characters.
      - Playbook zos_operator_basics.yaml has been updated to use end in the WTO reply
        over the previous use of cancel. Using cancel is not a valid reply and results
        in an execution error.
      known_issues:
      - When executing programs using zos_mvs_raw, you may encounter errors that originate
        in the implementation of the programs. Two such known issues are noted below
        of which one has been addressed with an APAR. - zos_mvs_raw module execution
        fails when invoking Database Image Copy 2 Utility or Database Recovery Utility
        in conjunction with FlashCopy or Fast Replication. - zos_mvs_raw module execution
        fails when invoking DFSRRC00 with parm "UPB,PRECOMP", "UPB, POSTCOMP" or "UPB,PRECOMP,POSTCOMP".
        This issue is addressed by APAR PH28089.
      minor_changes:
      - All modules support relative paths and remove choice case sensitivity.
      - zos_data_set added support to allocate and format zFS data sets.
      - zos_operator supports new options **wait** and **wait_time_s** such that you
        can specify that zos_operator wait the full **wait_time_s** or return as soon
        as the first operator command executes.

  1.3.3:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_copy was updated to correct deletion of all temporary files and unwarranted
        deletes. - When the module would complete, a cleanup routine did not take
        into account that other processes had open temporary files and thus would
        error when trying to remove them. - When the module would copy a directory
        (source) from USS to another USS directory (destination), any files currently
        in the destination would be deleted. The modules behavior has changed such
        that files are no longer deleted unless the force option is set to true. When
        **force=true**, copying files or a directory to a USS destination will continue
        if it encounters existing files or directories and overwrite any corresponding
        files.
      - zos_job_query was updated to correct a boolean condition that always evaluated
        to "CANCELLED". - When querying jobs that are either **CANCELLED** or have
        **FAILED**, they were always treated as **CANCELLED**.

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - jobs.py - fixes a utility used by module `zos_job_output` that would truncate
        the DD content. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_copy - fixes a bug that when a directory is copied from the controller
        to the managed node and a mode is set, the mode is now applied to the directory
        on the controller. If the directory being copied contains files and mode is
        set, mode will only be applied to the files being copied not the pre-existing
        files.(https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_copy - fixes a bug where options were not defined in the module argument
        spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` 2.11 and using
        options `force` or `mode`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_fetch - fixes a bug where an option was not defined in the module argument
        spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` 2.11 and using
        option `encoding`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_job_submit - fixes a bug where an option was not defined in the module

        using option `encoding`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_ssh - fixes connection plugin which will error when using `ansible-core`
        2.11 with an `AttributeError module 'ansible.constants' has no attribute 'ANSIBLE_SSH_CONTROL_PATH_DIR'`.

    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - zos_copy - enhanced to optimize how it captures the permission bits state
        for the `dest`. This change now reviews the source files instead of traversing
        the entire `dest` path. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/561)
      - zos_copy - enhanced to support creating a parent directory when it does not
        exist in the `dest` path. Prior to this change, if a parent directory anywhere
        in the path did not exist the task would fail as it was stated in documentation.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/561)
      - "zos_copy - enhanced to support system symbols in PARMLIB. System symbols
        are elements that allow different z/OS\xAE systems to share PARMLIB definitions
        while retaining unique values in those definitions. This was fixed in a future
        release through the use of one of the ZOAU dependency but this version of
        `ibm_zos_core` does not support that dependency version so this support was
        added. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/566)"

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_job_output was updated to correct possible truncated responses for the
        ddname content. This would occur for jobs with very large amounts of content
        from a ddname.
      - "zos_ssh - connection plugin was updated to correct a bug in Ansible that\n

      deprecated_features:
      - zos_copy and zos_fetch option sftp_port has been deprecated. To set the SFTP
        port, use the supported options in the ansible.builtin.ssh plugin. Refer to
        the `SSH port <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ssh_connection.html#parameter-port>`__
        option to configure the port used during the modules SFTP transport.
      - zos_copy module option model_ds has been removed. The model_ds logic is now
        automatically managed and data sets are either created based on the src data
        set or overridden by the new option destination_dataset.
      - zos_ssh connection plugin has been removed, it is no longer required. You
        must remove all playbook references to connection ibm.ibm_zos_core.zos_ssh.
      major_changes:
      - zos_copy was updated to support the ansible.builtin.ssh connection options;
        for further reference refer to the SSH plugin documentation.
      - zos_copy was updated to take into account the record length when the source
        is a USS file and the destination is a data set with a record length. This
        is done by inspecting the destination data set attributes and using these
        attributes to create a new data set.
      - zos_copy was updated with the capabilities to define destination data sets
        from within the zos_copy module. In the case where you are copying to a data
        set destination that does not exist, you can now do so using the new zos_copy
        module option destination.
      - zos_fetch was updated to support the ansible.builtin.ssh connection options;
        for further reference refer to the SSH plugin documentation.
      - zos_job_output was updated to to include the completion code (CC) for each
        individual job step as part of the ret_code response.
      - zos_job_query was updated to handle when an invalid job ID or job name is
        used with the module and returns a proper response.
      - zos_job_query was updated to support a 7 digit job number ID for when there
        are greater than 99,999 jobs in the history.
      - zos_job_submit was enhanced to check for 'JCL ERROR' when jobs are submitted
        and result in a proper module response.
      - zos_job_submit was updated to fail fast when a submitted job fails instead
        of waiting a predetermined time.
      - zos_operator_action_query response messages were improved with more diagnostic
        information in the event an error is encountered.
      - zos_ping was updated to remove the need for the zos_ssh connection plugin
        dependency.

        is set, mode will only be applied to the files being copied not the pre-existing
        files. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
      - zos_copy - fixes a bug where options were not defined in the module argument
        spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` v2.11 and using
        options `force` or `mode`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/496)
      - zos_copy - introduced an updated creation policy referred to as precedence
        rules such that if `dest_data_set` is set, this will take precedence. If `dest`
        is an empty data set, the empty data set will be written with the expectation
        its attributes satisfy the copy. If no precedent rule has been exercised,
        `dest` will be created with the same attributes of `src`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
      - zos_copy - introduced new computation capabilities such that if `dest` is
        a nonexistent data set, the attributes assigned will depend on the type of
        `src`. If `src` is a USS file, `dest` will have a Fixed Block (FB) record
        format and the remaining attributes will be computed. If `src` is binary,
        `dest` will have a Fixed Block (FB) record format with a record length of
        80, block size of 32760, and the remaining attributes will be computed. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
      - zos_copy - option `dest_dataset` has been deprecated and removed in favor
        of the new option `dest_data_set`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
      - zos_copy - was enhanced for when `src` is a directory and ends with "/", the
        contents of it will be copied into the root of `dest`. It it doesn't end with
        "/", the directory itself will be copied. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/496)

  1.5.0-beta.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug such that the module fails when copying files from
        a directory needing also to be encoded. The failure would also delete the
        `src` which was not desirable behavior. Fixes deletion of src on encoding
        error. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/321).
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug where copying a member from a loadlib to another loadlib
        fails. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/640)
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug where if a destination has accented characters in its
        content, the module would fail when trying to determine if it is empty. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/634)
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug where the computed record length for a new destination
        dataset would include newline characters. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/620)
      - zos_copy - Fixes wrongful creation of destination backups when module option
        `force` is true, creating emergency backups meant to restore the system to
        its initial state in case of a module failure only when force is false. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/590)
      - zos_copy - module was updated to correct a bug in the case when the destination
        (dest) is a PDSE and the source (src) is a Unix Systems File (USS). The module
        would fail in determining if the PDSE actually existed and try to create it
        when it already existed resulting in an error that would prevent the module
        from correctly executing. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/327)
      - zos_data_set - Fixes a bug such that the module will delete a catalogued data
        set over an uncatalogued data set even though the volume is provided for the
        uncataloged data set. This is unexpected behavior and does not align to documentation;
        correct behavior is that when a volume is provided that is the first place
        the module should look for the data set, whether or not it is cataloged. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/325).
      - zos_data_set - Fixes a bug where the default record format FB was actually
        never enforced and when enforced it would cause VSAM creation to fail with
        a Dynalloc failure. Also cleans up some of the options that are set by default
        when they have no bearing for batch. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/647)
      - zos_fetch - Updates the modules behavior when fetching VSAM data sets such
        that the maximum record length is now determined when creating a temporary
        data set to copy the VSAM data into and a variable-length (VB) data set is
        used. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/350)
      - zos_job_output - Fixes a bug that returned all ddname's when a specific ddnamae
        was provided. Now a specific ddname can be returned and all others ignored.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/334)
      - zos_job_query - was updated to correct a boolean condition that always evaluated
        to "CANCELLED". (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - zos_mount - Fixes option `tag_ccsid` to correctly allow for type int. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/511)
      - zos_mvs_raw - module was updated to correct a bug when no DD statements were
        provided. The module when no option was provided for `dds` would error, a
        default was provided to correct this behavior. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/336)
      - zos_operator - Fixes case sensitive error checks, invalid, error & unidentifiable
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - Fixes such that specifying wait_time_s would throw an error
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - Fixes the wait_time_s to default to 1 second (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - was updated to correct missing verbosity content when the option
        verbose was set to True. zos_operator - was updated to correct the trailing
        lines that would appear in the result content. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/400).
      deprecated_features:
      - zos_encode - deprecates the module options `from_encoding` and `to_encoding`
        to use suboptions `from` and `to` in order to remain consistent with all other
        modules. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/345).
      - zos_job_submit - Response 'message' property has been deprecated, all responses
        are now in response property 'msg'. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_job_submit - The 'wait' option has been deprecated because using option
        'wait_time_s' implies the job is going to wait. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      major_changes:
      - ibm_zos_core - Updates the entire collection in that the collection no longer
        depends on the managed node having installed System Display and Search Facility
        (SDSF). Remove SDSF dependency from ibm_zos_core collection. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/303).
      minor_changes:
      - module utility jobs - was updated to remove the usage of REXX and replaced
        with ZOAU python APIs. This reduces code replication and it removes the need
        for REXX interpretation which increases performance. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - module utils backup - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq.
        This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ)
        used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults
        are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - module utils dd_statement- updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq.
        This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ)
        used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults
        are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - module utils encode - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq.
        This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ)
        used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults
        are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_apf - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_blockinfile - fixes a bug when using double quotes in the block text of
        the module. When double quotes appeared in block text, the module would error
        differently depending on the usage of option insertafter. Examples of this
        error have return code 1 or 16 along with message "ZOAU dmod return content
        is NOT in json format" and a varying stderr. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/303).
      - zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named force. This allows
        for a user to specify that the data set can be shared with others during an
        update which results in the data set you are updating to be simultaneously
        updated by others. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/316).
      - zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named indentation.
        This allows for a user to specify a number of spaces to prepend to the content
        before being inserted into the destination. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/317).
      - zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This
        allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used
        in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not
        permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_copy - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_data_set - Ensures that temporary datasets created by zos_data_set use
        the tmp_hlq specified. This allows for a user to specify the data set high
        level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module.
        Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override
        the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/491).
      - zos_encode - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_fetch - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_gather_facts - is a new module that can discover facts about the managed
        z/OS target. This module leverages the zinfo utility offered by ZOAU. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/322).
      - zos_job_output - was updated to leverage the latest changes that removes the
        REXX code by calling the module utility jobs. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - zos_job_query - was updated to leverage the latest changes that removes the
        REXX code by calling the module utility jobs. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - zos_job_query - was updated to use the jobs module utility. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - zos_job_submit - The architecture changed such that the entire modules execution
        time now captured in the duration time which includes job submission and log
        collection. If a job does not return by the default 10 sec 'wait_time_s' value,
        it can be increased up to 86400 seconds. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_job_submit - behavior changed when a volume is defined in the module options
        such that it will catalog the data set if it is not cataloged and submit the
        job. In the past, the function did not catalog the data set and instead performed
        I/O operations and then submitted the job. This behavior aligns to other module
        behaviors and reduces the possibility to encounter a permissions issue. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_job_submit - was updated to include an additional error code condition
        JCLERR. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312)
      - zos_lineinfile- updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_mount - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_mvs_raw - Ensures that temporary datasets created by DD Statements use
        the tmp_hlq specified. This allows for a user to specify the data set high
        level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module.
        Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override
        the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/414).
      - zos_mvs_raw - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_operator - added in the response the cmd result (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - added in the response the elapsed time (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - added in the response the wait_time_s set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - deprecated the wait option, not needed with wait_time_s minor_changes
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - was updated to remove the usage of REXX and replaced with ZOAU
