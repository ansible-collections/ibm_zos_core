breaking_changes:
  - zos_job_output - Option name ``ddname`` is substituted for ``dd_name``, but ``ddname`` is kept as an alias. Return value ``changed`` is always returned and return value ``steps`` are no longer under ``ret_code``
    but is now included under `jobs`. Return value ``ddnames`` is replaced by ``dds`` and value ``ddname`` under ``ddnames`` is replaced by ``dd_name``.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2208).
  - zos_job_submit - Interface value ``location`` is replace for ``remote_src`` in a bool value and ``wait_time_s`` is replaced for ``wait_time``.
    Return value ``ddnames`` replaced by ``dds`` and value ``ddname`` under ``ddnames`` is replace by ``dd_name``. Now all values are returned under ``jobs`` except ``changed``.

trivial:
  - test/zos_job_query_func.py - Update test validation to new values for job submit. Return value ``steps`` are no longer under `ret_code`
    but is now included under `jobs`.
