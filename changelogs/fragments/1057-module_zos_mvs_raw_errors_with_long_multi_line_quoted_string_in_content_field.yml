minor_changes:
  - zos_mvs_raw - when using the dd_input content option for instream-data, if
    the content was not properly indented according to the program which is
    generally a blank in columns 1 & 2, those columns would be truncated. Now,
    when setting instream-data, the module will ensure that all lines contain
    a blank in columns 1 and 2 and add blanks when not present while retaining
    a maximum length of 80 columns for any line. This is true for all content
    types; string, list of strings and when using a YAML block indicator.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1057).
   - zos_mvs_raw - no examples were included with the module that demonstrated
     using a YAML block indicator, this now includes examples using a YAML
     block indicator.
