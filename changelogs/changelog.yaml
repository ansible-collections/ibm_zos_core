  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Action plugin zos_copy was updated to support Python 2.7.
      - Job utility is an internal library used by several modules. It has been updated
        to use a custom written parsing routine capable of handling special characters
        to prevent job related reading operations from failing when a special character
        is encountered.
      - Module zos_copy was updated to fail gracefully when a it encounters a non-zero
        return code.
      - Module zos_copy was updated to support copying data set members that are program
        objects to a PDSE. Prior to this update, copying data set members would yield
        an error; - FSUM8976 Error writing <src_data_set_member> to PDSE member <dest_data_set_member>
      - Module zos_job_submit referenced a non-existent option and was corrected to
        **wait_time_s**.
      - Module zos_job_submit was updated to remove all trailing **\r** from jobs
        that are submitted from the controller.
      - Module zos_tso_command support was added for when the command output contained
        special characters.
      - Playbook zos_operator_basics.yaml has been updated to use end in the WTO reply
        over the previous use of cancel. Using cancel is not a valid reply and results
        in an execution error.
      known_issues:
      - When executing programs using zos_mvs_raw, you may encounter errors that originate
        in the implementation of the programs. Two such known issues are noted below
        of which one has been addressed with an APAR. - zos_mvs_raw module execution
        fails when invoking Database Image Copy 2 Utility or Database Recovery Utility
        in conjunction with FlashCopy or Fast Replication. - zos_mvs_raw module execution
        fails when invoking DFSRRC00 with parm "UPB,PRECOMP", "UPB, POSTCOMP" or "UPB,PRECOMP,POSTCOMP".
        This issue is addressed by APAR PH28089.
      minor_changes:
      - All modules support relative paths and remove choice case sensitivity.
      - zos_data_set added support to allocate and format zFS data sets.
      - zos_operator supports new options **wait** and **wait_time_s** such that you
        can specify that zos_operator wait the full **wait_time_s** or return as soon
        as the first operator command executes.

  1.3.3:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_copy was updated to correct deletion of all temporary files and unwarranted
        deletes. - When the module would complete, a cleanup routine did not take
        into account that other processes had open temporary files and thus would
        error when trying to remove them. - When the module would copy a directory
        (source) from USS to another USS directory (destination), any files currently
        in the destination would be deleted. The modules behavior has changed such
        that files are no longer deleted unless the force option is set to true. When
        **force=true**, copying files or a directory to a USS destination will continue
        if it encounters existing files or directories and overwrite any corresponding
        files.
      - zos_job_query was updated to correct a boolean condition that always evaluated
        to "CANCELLED". - When querying jobs that are either **CANCELLED** or have
        **FAILED**, they were always treated as **CANCELLED**.

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - 'zos_job_output - fixes a bug that returned all ddname''s when a specific
        ddname was provided. Now a specific ddname can be returned and all others
        ignored. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/334)

        '
      - "zos_ssh - connection plugin was updated to correct a bug in Ansible that\n
        \ would result in playbook task retries overriding the SSH connection\n  retries.
        This is resolved by renaming the zos_ssh option\n  retries to reconnection_retries.
        The update addresses users of\n  ansible-core v2.9 which continues to use
        retries and users of\n  ansible-core v2.11 or later which uses reconnection_retries.\n
