Requirements
============

A control node is any machine with Ansible installed. From the control node,
you can run commands and playbooks from a laptop, desktop, or server machine.
However, you cannot run **IBM z/OS Core Collection** on a Windows machine.

A managed node is often referred to as a target node, or host, and is the node
that is managed by Ansible. Ansible does not need not need to be installed on
a managed node, but SSH must be enabled.

The following nodes require specific versions of software:

Control node
------------

* `Ansible version`_: 2.9 or later
* `Python`_: 2.7 or later
* `OpenSSH`_

Managed node
------------

* `Python on Z`_: 3.6 or later
* `zOS`_: V02.02.00 or later
* `IBM Z Open Automation Utilities`_ (ZOAU)

If the Ansible target is z/OS, you must install a python distribution ported
for this platform. Rocket Software is currently the preferred version for z/OS.
