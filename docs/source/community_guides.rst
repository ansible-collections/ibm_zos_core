Parsing with BetterArgParser
----------------------------

BetterArgParser goes beyond typical option value parsing and serves as an
alternative to parsers such as argparse. It has been designed to validate
values often used on z/OS to avoid unnecessary failures on the target
such as incorrectly providing a data set name or type. For cases that require
further validation, BetterArgParser accepts a BetterArg object that allows for
further customization.

It is recommended to use BetterArgParser in conjunction with Ansible's
module argument parser.

This section outlines the features of BetterArgParser, explains how to define arguments,
provides examples of dependencies and more:
