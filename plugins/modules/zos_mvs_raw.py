              - I(oappend) sets the file offset to the end of the file before each write,
                so that data is written at the end of the file.
              - I(ocreat) specifies that if the file does not exist, the system is to create it.
                If a directory specified in the pathname does not exist, a new directory and a new file are not created.
                If the file already exists and I(oexcl) was not specified,
                the system allows the program to use the existing file.
                If the file already exists and I(oexcl) was specified,
                the system fails the allocation and the job step.

                If the file already exists, the system fails the allocation and the job step.
                The system ignores I(oexcl) if I(ocreat) is not also specified.
              - I(onoctty) specifies that if the PATH parameter identifies a terminal device,
                opening of the file does not make the terminal device the controlling terminal for the process.
              - I(ononblock) specifies the following, depending on the type of file
              - For a FIFO special file
              - 1. With I(ononblock) specified and I(ordonly) access,
                   an open function for reading-only returns without delay.
              - 2. With I(ononblock) not specified and I(ordonly) access,
                   an open function for reading-only blocks (waits) until a
                   process opens the file for writing.
              - 3. With I(ononblock) specified and I(owronly) access,
                   an open function for writing-only returns an error if no
                   process currently has the file open for reading.
              - 4. With I(ononblock) not specified and I(owronly) access,
                   an open function for writing-only blocks (waits) until a
                   process opens the file for reading.
              - 5. For a character special file that supports nonblocking open
              - 6. If I(ononblock) is specified, an open function returns without
                   blocking (waiting) until the device is ready or available.
                   Device response depends on the type of device.
              - 7. If I(ononblock) is not specified, an open function blocks
                   (waits) until the device is ready or available.
              - I(ononblock) has no effect on other file types.
              - I(osync) specifies that the system is to move data from buffer storage
                to permanent storage before returning control from a callable service that performs a write.
              - "I(otrunc) specifies that the system is to truncate the file length to zero if
                all the following are true: the file specified exists,
                the file is a regular file,
                and the file successfully opened with I(ordwr) or I(owronly)."
              - When I(otrunc) is specified, the system does not change the mode and owner.

notes:
    - When executing programs using L(zos_mvs_raw,./zos_mvs_raw.html), you may encounter errors
      that originate in the programs implementation. Two such known issues are
      noted below of which one has been addressed with an APAR.
    - 1. L(zos_mvs_raw,./zos_mvs_raw.html) module execution fails when invoking
      Database Image Copy 2 Utility or Database Recovery Utility in conjunction
      with FlashCopy or Fast Replication.
    - 2. L(zos_mvs_raw,./zos_mvs_raw.html) module execution fails when invoking DFSRRC00 with parm
      "UPB,PRECOMP", "UPB, POSTCOMP" or "UPB,PRECOMP,POSTCOMP". This issue is
      addressed by APAR PH28089.
    - 3. When executing a program, refer to the programs documentation as each programs requirments
      can vary fom DDs, instream-data indentation and continuation characters.
