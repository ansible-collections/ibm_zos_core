    zos_ssh - connection plugin was updated to correct a bug in Ansible that
      would result in playbook task retries overriding the SSH connection
      retries. This is resolved by renaming the zos_ssh option
      retries to reconnection_retries. The update addresses users of
      ansible-core v2.9 which continues to use retries and users of
      ansible-core v2.11 or later which uses reconnection_retries.
      This also resolves a bug in the connection that referenced a deprecated
      constant. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/328)
