bugfixes:
- zos_fetch - Updates the modules behavior when fetching VSAM data sets such
  that the maximum record length is now determined when creating a temporary
  data set to copy the VSAM data into and a variable-length (VB) data set is
  used. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/350)
