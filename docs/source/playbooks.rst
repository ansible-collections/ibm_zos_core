Playbooks
=========

An `Ansible playbook`_ consists of organized instructions that define work for
a managed node (host) to be managed with Ansible.

Sample playbooks that demonstrate how to use the collection content are
**included** in the **IBM z/OS core collection**. You can find the samples on
`Github`_ or in the collections playbooks directory included with the
installation. For more information about the collections installation and
hierarchy, refer to the main `installation`_ documentation.

.. _Github:
   https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/tree/master/playbooks

.. _installation:
   https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/installation/installation.html

You can run the sample playbook with the ``ansible-playbook`` command with some
modification to the **inventory**, **ansible.cfg** and **group_vars**.
