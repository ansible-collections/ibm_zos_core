bugfixes:
  - zos_mvs_raw - module wasn't able to write a multi-line JCL because it truncated
    the first one or two characters, resulting in syntactically incorrect JCL.
    Change now validates the length of lines and allow multi-line declaration with | or |1-9 by adding
    two spaces to be syntactically correct.
