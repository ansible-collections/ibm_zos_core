minor_changes:
- zos_job_submit - behavior changed when a volume is defined in the module options
  such that it will catalog the data set if it is not cataloged and submit the
  job. In the past, the function did not catalog the data set and instead performed
  I/O operations and then submitted the job. This behavior aligns to other module
  behaviors and reduces the possibility to encounter a permissions issue.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_job_submit - The architecture changed such that the entire modules execution
  time now captured in the duration time which includes job submission and log
  collection. If a job does not return by the default 10 sec 'wait_time_s' value,
  it can be increased up to 86400 seconds.

trivial:
- zos_job_submit - updated to remove a temporary patch put in place to manage
  when the src JCL is in USS because prior versions of ZOAU did not correctly
  handle JCL in USS.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/549)
- zos_job_submit - added test cases to drive both `wait_time_s` and submitting
  a job in an uncataloged data set
