=========
Playbooks
=========

An `Ansible playbook`_ consists of organized instructions that define work for
a managed node (host) to be managed with Ansible.

If you would like to try a collection, use one of the many playbooks
available in our playbook repository contributed by the
**Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** team.

Each playbook in the `playbook repository`_ includes documentation and explains
the steps performed. The `playbook repository`_ categorizes playbooks into
**z/OS concepts** and **topics**, it also covers `playbook configuration`_ as
well as provide additional community content such as **blogs** and where to open
`support tickets`_ for the playbooks.

Before running an Ansible playbook, please review these resources:
     
     * Basic concepts common to playbooks, required artifacts to run a playbook, and
       debugging instructions documented in the `playbooks`_ section.
       
     * The `playbook configuration`_ topic to learn about the required environment
       parameters documented in our playbook repository. 
     
     * The `FAQs`_ for additional help on configuring playbooks and troubleshooting tips.
