    """This class serves as a wrapper for any kind of error when importing
    ZOAU. Since ZOAU is used by both modules and module_utils, we need a way
    to alert the user when they're trying to use a function that couldn't be
    imported properly. If we only had to deal with this in modules, we could
    just validate that imports worked at the start of their main functions,
    but on utils, we don't have an entry point where we can validate this.
    Just raising an exception when trying the import would be better, but that
    introduces a failure on Ansible sanity tests, so we can't do it.

    Instead, we'll replace what would've been a ZOAU library with this class,
    and the moment ANY method gets called, we finally raise an exception.
    When creating a new instance of this class, we save the traceback
    from the original exception so that users have more context when their
    task/code fails. The expected traceback is a string representation of
    it, not an actual traceback object. By importing `traceback` from the
    standard library and calling `traceback.format_exc()` we can
    get this string.

        exception_traceback {} -- The formatted traceback of the exception
