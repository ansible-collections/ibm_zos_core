minor_changes:
- zos_job_submit - deprecated the wait option, not needed with
  wait_time_s minor_changes.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_job_submit - behavior changed when a volume is defined in the module options
  such that it will catalog the data set if it is not cataloged and submit the
  job. In the past, the function did not catalog the data set and instead performed
  I/O operations and then submitted the job. This behavior aligns to other module
  behaviors and reduces the possibility to encounter a permissions issue.
trivial:
- zos_job_submit - updated to remove a temporary patch put in place to manage
  when the src is USS JCL because prior versions of ZOAU did not correctly handle
  JCL in USS when the option passed along was hfs=True this now drives ZOAU 1.2.1
  capabilities.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/549)
- zos_job_submit - added test cases to drive both `wait_time_s` and submitting
  a job in an uncataloged data set
