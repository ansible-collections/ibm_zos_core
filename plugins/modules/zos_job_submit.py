short_description: Submit JCL
description:
    - Submit JCL in a data set, USS file, or file on the controller.
    - Submit a job and monitor for completion.
    - For an uncataloged dataset, specify the volume serial number.
version_added: "1.0.0"
options:
  src:
    required: true
    type: str
    description:
      - The source file or data set containing the JCL to submit.
      - It could be a physical sequential data set, a partitioned data set
        qualified by a member or a path. (e.g "USER.TEST","USER.JCL(TEST)")
      - Or a USS file. (e.g "/u/tester/demo/sample.jcl")
      - Or a LOCAL file in ansible control node.
        (e.g "/User/tester/ansible-playbook/sample.jcl")
  location:
    required: false
    default: DATA_SET
    type: str
    choices:
      - DATA_SET
      - USS
      - LOCAL
    description:
      - The JCL location. Supported choices are ``DATA_SET``, ``USS`` or ``LOCAL``.
      - DATA_SET can be a PDS, PDSE, or sequential data set.
      - USS means the JCL location is located in UNIX System Services (USS).
      - LOCAL means locally to the ansible control node.
  wait_time_s:
    required: false
    default: 10
    type: int
    description:
      - Option I(wait_time_s) is the total time that module
        L(zos_job_submit,./zos_job_submit.html) will wait for a submitted job
        to complete. The time begins when the module is executed on the managed
        node.
      - I(wait_time_s) is measured in seconds and must be a value greater than 0
        and less than 86400.
  max_rc:
    required: false
    type: int
    description:
      - Specifies the maximum return code allowed for any job step for the submitted job.
  return_output:
    required: false
    default: true
    type: bool
    description:
      - Whether to print the DD output.
      - If false, an empty list will be returned in the ddnames field.
  volume:
    required: false
    type: str
    description:
      - The volume serial (VOLSER)is where the data set resides. The option
        is required only when the data set is not cataloged on the system.
      - When configured, the L(zos_job_submit,./zos_job_submit.html) will try to
        catalog the data set for the volume serial. If it is not able to, the
        module will fail.
      - Ignored for I(location=USS) and I(location=LOCAL).
  encoding:
    description:
      - Specifies which encoding the local JCL file should be converted from
        and to, before submitting the job.
      - This option is only supported for when I(location=LOCAL).
      - If this parameter is not provided, and the z/OS systems default encoding
        can not be identified, the JCL file will be converted from UTF-8 to
        IBM-1047 by default, otherwise the module will detect the z/OS system
        encoding.
    required: false
    type: dict
    suboptions:
      from:
        description:
          - The character set of the local JCL file; defaults to UTF-8.
          - Supported character sets rely on the target platform; the most
            common character sets are supported.

            z/OS system; defaults to IBM-1047 when z/OS systems default encoding
            can not be identified.
          - If not provided, the module will attempt to identify and use the
            default encoding on the z/OS system.
          - Supported character sets rely on the target version; the most
            common character sets are supported.

        type: str

extends_documentation_fragment:
  - ibm.ibm_zos_core.template

notes:
  - For supported character sets used to encode data, refer to the
    L(documentation,https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zos_core/docs/source/resources/character_set.html).
  - This module uses L(zos_copy,./zos_copy.html) to copy local scripts to
    the remote machine which uses SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for the
    underlying transfer protocol; SCP (secure copy protocol) and Co:Z SFTP are not
    supported. In the case of Co:z SFTP, you can exempt the Ansible user id on z/OS
    from using Co:Z thus falling back to using standard SFTP. If the module detects
    SCP, it will temporarily use SFTP for transfers, if not available, the module
    will fail.
