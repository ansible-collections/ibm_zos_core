enhancements:
  - job.py - new routine available called dsname_escape.
    This routine will ensure a dataset name complies to the naming rules, and is escaped for cmd line compatibility.
    It will also raise a value error if any data set name rules are violated.

bugfixes:
  - zos_data_set - Uses new dsname_escape to make sure data set names are usable.
