    zos_blockinfile - fixes a bug when using double quotes in the block text
    of the module. When double quotes appeared in block text, the module would
    error differently depending on the usage insertafter. Examples of this
    error have return code 1 or 16 along with message
    "ZOAU dmod return content is NOT in json format" and a varying stderr.
