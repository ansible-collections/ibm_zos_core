bugfixes:
  - Action plugin zos_copy was updated to support Python 2.7.
  - Module zos_copy was updated to fail gracefully when a it
    encounters a non-zero return code.
  - Module zos_copy was updated to support copying data set members that
    are program objects to a PDSE. Prior to this update, copying data set
    members would yield an error;
      - FSUM8976 Error writing <src_data_set_member> to PDSE member
        <dest_data_set_member>
  - Job utility is an internal library used by several modules. It has been
    updated to use a custom written parsing routine capable of handling
    special characters to prevent job related reading operations from failing
    when a special character is encountered.
  - Module zos_job_submit was updated to remove all trailing **\r** from
    jobs that are submitted from the controller.
  - Module zos_job_submit referenced a non-existent option and was
    corrected to **wait_time_s**.
  - Module zos_tso_command support was added for when the command output
    contained special characters.
  - Playbook zos_operator_basics.yaml has been updated to use end in the
    WTO reply over the previous use of cancel. Using cancel is not a
    valid reply and results in an execution error.
