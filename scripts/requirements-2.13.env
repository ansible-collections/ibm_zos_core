# File name must adhere to reqs-<ansible-major-minor>.sh, supporting concurrent
# patches could come and to do that you would want to not use unique files for
# each ansible version but instead have this file provide the meta-data such
# the sourcing scrips know to create additional ansible venvs and maybe even
# clean up if they are removed from this file.
# eg venvs = [requirements, requirements2, requirments3]
