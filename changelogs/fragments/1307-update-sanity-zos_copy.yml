minor_changes:
  - zos_copy - Documented `group` and `owner` options.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1307).

trivial:
  - zos_copy - Removed many of the variables that were passed from the
    action plugin to the module, reimplementing the logic inside the
    module instead. Removed the use of temp_path variable inside zos_copy
    in favor of using remote_src to deal with files copied to remote.
