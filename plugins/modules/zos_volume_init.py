module: zos_volume_init
short_description: Initialize volumes or minidisks.
description:
  - Initialize a volume or minidisk on z/OS.
  - I(zos_volume_init) will create the volume label and entry into the volume
    table of contents (VTOC).
  - Volumes are used for storing data and executable programs.
  - A minidisk is a portion of a disk that is linked to your virtual machine.
  - A VTOC lists the data sets that reside on a volume, their location, size, and
    other attributes.
  - I(zos_volume_init) uses the ICKDSF command INIT to initialize a volume. In some
    cases the command could be protected by facility class `STGADMIN.ICK.INIT`.
    Protection occurs when the class is active, and the class profile is defined.
    Ensure the user executing the Ansible task is permitted to execute
    ICKDSF command INIT, otherwise, any user can use the command.
  - ICKDSF is an Authorized Program Facility (APF) program on z/OS,
    I(zos_volume_init) will run in authorized mode but if the program ICKDSF is
    not APF authorized, the task will end.
  - Note that defaults set on target z/OS systems may override ICKDSF parameters.
  - If is recommended that data on the volume is backed up as the I(zos_volume_init)
    module will not perform any backups. You can use the
    L(zos_backup_restore,./zos_backup_restore.html) module to backup a volume.

  address:
    description:
      - I(address) is a 3 or 4 digit hexadecimal number that specifies the
        address of the volume or minidisk.
      - I(address) can be the number assigned to the device (device number)
        when it is installed or the virtual address.
    required: true

  verify_volid:
    description:
      - Verify that the volume serial matches what is on the existing volume or minidisk.
      - I(verify_volid) must be 1 to 6 alphanumeric characters or "*NONE*".
      - To verify that a volume serial number does not exist, use
        I(verify_volid="*NONE*").
      - If I(verify_volid) is specified and the volume serial number does not
        match that found on the volume or minidisk, initialization does not complete.
      - If I(verify_volid="*NONE*") is specified and a volume serial is found on
        the volume or minidisk, initialization does not complete.
      - Note, this option is B(not) a boolean, leave it blank to skip the verification.

  volid:
    description:
      - The volume serial number used to initialize a volume or minidisk.
      - Expects 1-6 alphanumeric, national ($,#,@) or special characters.
      - A I(volid) with less than 6 characters will be padded with spaces.
      - A I(volid) can also be referred to as volser or volume serial number.
      - When I(volid) is not specified for a previously initialized volume or
        minidisk, the volume serial number will remain unchanged.
    required: false

  vtoc_size:
    description:
      - The number of tracks to initialize the volume table of contents (VTOC) with.
      - The VTOC will be placed in cylinder 0 head 1.
      - If no tracks are specified it will default to the number of tracks in a
        cylinder minus 1. Tracks in a cylinder vary based on direct-access storage
        device (DASD) models, for 3390 a cylinder is 15 tracks.
    required: false

  index:
    description:
      - Create a volume table of contents (VTOC) index.
      - The VTOC index enhances the performance of VTOC access.
      - When set to I(false), no index will be created.
    required: false

  sms_managed:
    description:
      - Specifies that the volume be managed by Storage Management System (SMS).

        index or the VSAM Volume Data Set(VVDS) exist on the target volume.
    required: false

  tmp_hlq:
    description:
      - Override the default high level qualifier (HLQ) for temporary and backup
        datasets.
      - The default HLQ is the Ansible user used to execute the module and if
        that is not available, then the value C(TMPHLQ) is used.
