description:
  - Display the z/OS job output for a given criteria (Job id/Job name/owner)
    with/without a data definition name as a filter.
  - At least provide a job id/job name/owner.
  - The job id can be specific such as "STC02560", or one that uses a pattern
    such as "STC*" or "*".
  - The job name can be specific such as "TCPIP", or one that uses a pattern
    such as "TCP*" or "*".
