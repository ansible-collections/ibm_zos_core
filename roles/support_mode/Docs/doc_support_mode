role: support_mode
short_description: Gathers diagnostic facts from z/OS managed nodes and the Ansible controller.
description:
    - >
      The B(support_mode) role gathers a comprehensive set of diagnostic facts
      from both the z/OS managed node and the Ansible controller node.
    - >
      B(Managed Node (z/OS):) Gathers ZOAU version, Python version, locale,
      environment variables, user limits, pip packages, z/OS system facts,
      OMVS segment, filesystem mount status, and ZOAU APF attributes.
    - >
      B(Controller Node:) Gathers Ansible version, SSH version, Ansible config,
      locale, installed collections, environment, and system facts.
    - >
      This role can create separate YAML report files for the z/OS node
      (C(support_mode_report_<hostname>.yml)) and the controller node
      (C(support_mode_report_localhost.yml)) in the user's home directory.
    - >
      Facts are also set on the respective hosts: C(support_mode_managed_results)
      on the z/OS host and C(support_mode_controller_results) on localhost.
