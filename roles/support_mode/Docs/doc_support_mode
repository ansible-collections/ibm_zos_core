role: support_mode
short_description: Gathers diagnostic facts from a z/OS managed node.
description:
    - >
      The B(support_mode) role gathers a comprehensive set of diagnostic facts
      from a z/OS managed node.
    - >
      This includes information about the ZOAU installation, Python version,
      system locale, environment variables, installed pip packages,
      z/OS system facts, and filesystem mount status for
      ZOAU and Python.
    - >
      All gathered information is consolidated and saved to a YAML report file
      C(support_mode_report_<hostname>.yml) in the user's home
      directory on the Ansible controller.
    - >
      A fact named C(support_mode_managed_results) is also set on the
      managed host with the same data.
