module: zos_stat
version_added: '1.14.0'
author:
  - "Ivan Moreno (@rexemin)"
short_description: Retrieve facts from MVS data sets, USS files, aggregates and generation data groups
description:
  - The L(zos_stat,./zos_stat.html) module retrieves facts from resources
    stored in a z/OS system.
  - Resources that can be queried are UNIX System Services files, data sets,
    generation data groups and aggregates.
options:
  name:
    description:
        - Name of a data set, generation data group (GDG), aggregate,
          or a UNIX System Services file path, to query.
        - Data sets can be sequential, partitioned (PDS), partitioned
          extended (PDSE), VSAMs or generation data sets (GDS).
        - This option doesn't accept the use of wilcards (? and *).
    type: str
    required: true
    aliases:
      - src
  volumes:
    description:
        - Name(s) of the volume(s) where the data set will be searched on.
        - If omitted, the module will look up the master catalog to find
          all volumes where a data set is allocated.
        - When used, if the data set is not found in at least one volume
          from the list, the module will fail with a "data set not found"
          message.
    type: list
    elements: str

      - file
      - aggregate
      - gdg
  sms_managed:
    description:
        - Whether the data set is managed by the Storage Management Subsystem.
        - It will cause the module to retrieve additional information, may
          take longer to query all attributes of a data set.
        - If the data set is a PDSE and the Ansible user has RACF READ authority
          on it, retrieving SMS information will update the last referenced
          date of the data set.
        - If the system finds the data set is not actually managed by SMS, the
          rest of the attributes will still be queried and this will be noted
          in the output from the task.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  recall:
    description:
      - Whether to recall a migrated data set to fully query its
        attributes.
      - If set to C(false), the module will return a limited amount of
        information for a migrated data set.
      - Recalling a data set will make the module take longer to execute.
      - Ignored when the data set is not found to be migrated.
      - The data set will not be migrated again afterwards.
      - The data set will not get recalled when running the module in
        check mode.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  tmp_hlq:
    description:
      - Override the default high level qualifier (HLQ) for temporary data
        sets.
      - The default HLQ is the Ansible user used to execute the module and
        if that is not available, then the environment variable value
        C(TMPHLQ) is used.
    type: str
    required: false
  follow:
    description:
      - Whether to follow symlinks when querying files.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  get_mime:
    description:
      - Whether to get information about the nature of a file, such as the charset
        and type of media it represents.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: true
  get_checksum:
    description:
      - Whether to compute a file's checksum and return it. Otherwise ignored.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: true
  checksum_algorithm:
    description:
      - Algorithm used to compute a file's checksum.
      - Will throw an error if the managed node is unable to use the
        specified algorithm.
    type: str
    required: false
    default: "sha1"
    choices:
      - "md5"
      - "sha1"
      - "sha224"
      - "sha256"
      - "sha384"
      - "sha512"

attributes:
  action:
    support: none
    description: Indicates this has a corresponding action plugin so some parts of the options can be executed on the controller.
  async:
    support: full
    description: Supports being used with the ``async`` keyword.
  check_mode:
    support: full
    description: Can run in check_mode and return changed status prediction without modifying target. If not supported, the action will be skipped.

notes:
  - When querying data sets, the module will create two temporary data sets.
    One requires around 4 kilobytes of available space on the managed node.
    The second one, around 1 kilobyte of available space. Both data sets will
    be removed before the module finishes execution.
  - Sometimes, the system could be unable to properly determine the
    organization or record format of the data set or the space units used
    to represent its allocation. When this happens, the values for these
    fields will be null.
  - When querying a partitioned data set (PDS), if the Ansible user has
    RACF READ authority on it, the last referenced date will be updated by
    the query operation.
