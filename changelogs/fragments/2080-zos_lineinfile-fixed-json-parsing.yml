bugfixes:
  - zos_lineinfile - The module would report a false negative when certain special characters 
    where present in the `line` option. Fix now reports the successful operation.

trivial:
  - test_zos_lineinfile_func - added test case to verify insertbefore functionality with regex pattern before Ansible block line.
