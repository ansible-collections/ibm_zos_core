bugfixes:
  - zos_lineinfile - Fixed an issue where the module fail with a JSON parsing error
    when using `zoau` commands, even if the updates were successfully applied. The output is now
    cleaned before parsing, ensuring that tasks only fail when there's an actual problem.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/2080)
trivial:
  - test_zos_lineinfile_func - added test case to verify insertbefore functionality with regex pattern before Ansible block line.
