============
Requirements
============

The **IBM z/OS core collection** requires both a **control node** and
**managed node** be configured with a minimum set of requirements. The
control node is often referred to as the **controller** and the
managed node as the **host**.

Control node
============
The controller is where the Ansible engine that runs the playbook is installed.
Refer to RedHat Ansible Certified Content documentation for more on the `controllers dependencies`_.

Managed node
============

The managed z/OS node is the host that is managed by Ansible, as identified in the Ansible inventory.
The managed node has dependencies that are specific to each release of the
**IBM z/OS core collection**. Review the details of the dependencies before you
proceed to install the IBM z/OS core collection.
