    - >
      The B(IBM z/OSMF collection) provides an Ansible role, referred to as
      B(job_status), to create an instance of manually
      configured z/OS software such as IBM Customer Information Control System
      (CICS®), IBM Db2®, IBM Information Management System (IMS™), IBM MQ, and
      IBM WebSphere Application Server or any other z/OS Software in
      B(IBM Cloud Provisioning and Management (CP&M)) registry.
