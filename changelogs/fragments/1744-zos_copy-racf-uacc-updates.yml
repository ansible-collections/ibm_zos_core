bugfixes:
  - zos_copy - Improve module zos_copy error handling when the user does not have
    universal access authority set to UACC(READ) for SAF Profile
    'MVS.MCSOPER.ZOAU' and SAF Class OPERCMDS. The module now handles the exception
    and returns an informative message.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1744).
trivial:
  - pipeline - Deliver a new users.py framework that allows functional test cases to
    request a managed user type where this user can have limited access to some SAF
    profile, or saf class as well as user id's with specific patterns such as including
    supported special characters such as '@', '#', etc.
