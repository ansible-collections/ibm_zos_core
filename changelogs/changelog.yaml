  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Action plugin zos_copy was updated to support Python 2.7.
      - Job utility is an internal library used by several modules. It has been updated
        to use a custom written parsing routine capable of handling special characters
        to prevent job related reading operations from failing when a special character
        is encountered.
      - Module zos_copy was updated to fail gracefully when a it encounters a non-zero
        return code.
      - Module zos_copy was updated to support copying data set members that are program
        objects to a PDSE. Prior to this update, copying data set members would yield
        an error; - FSUM8976 Error writing <src_data_set_member> to PDSE member <dest_data_set_member>
      - Module zos_job_submit referenced a non-existent option and was corrected to
        **wait_time_s**.
      - Module zos_job_submit was updated to remove all trailing **\r** from jobs
        that are submitted from the controller.
      - Module zos_tso_command support was added for when the command output contained
        special characters.
      - Playbook zos_operator_basics.yaml has been updated to use end in the WTO reply
        over the previous use of cancel. Using cancel is not a valid reply and results
        in an execution error.
      known_issues:
      - When executing programs using zos_mvs_raw, you may encounter errors that originate
        in the implementation of the programs. Two such known issues are noted below
        of which one has been addressed with an APAR. - zos_mvs_raw module execution
        fails when invoking Database Image Copy 2 Utility or Database Recovery Utility
        in conjunction with FlashCopy or Fast Replication. - zos_mvs_raw module execution
        fails when invoking DFSRRC00 with parm "UPB,PRECOMP", "UPB, POSTCOMP" or "UPB,PRECOMP,POSTCOMP".
        This issue is addressed by APAR PH28089.
      minor_changes:
      - All modules support relative paths and remove choice case sensitivity.
      - zos_data_set added support to allocate and format zFS data sets.
      - zos_operator supports new options **wait** and **wait_time_s** such that you
        can specify that zos_operator wait the full **wait_time_s** or return as soon
        as the first operator command executes.

  1.3.3:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_copy was updated to correct deletion of all temporary files and unwarranted
        deletes. - When the module would complete, a cleanup routine did not take
        into account that other processes had open temporary files and thus would
        error when trying to remove them. - When the module would copy a directory
        (source) from USS to another USS directory (destination), any files currently
        in the destination would be deleted. The modules behavior has changed such
        that files are no longer deleted unless the force option is set to true. When
        **force=true**, copying files or a directory to a USS destination will continue
        if it encounters existing files or directories and overwrite any corresponding
        files.
      - zos_job_query was updated to correct a boolean condition that always evaluated
        to "CANCELLED". - When querying jobs that are either **CANCELLED** or have
        **FAILED**, they were always treated as **CANCELLED**.

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - jobs.py - fixes a utility used by module `zos_job_output` that would truncate
        the DD content. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_copy - fixes a bug that when a directory is copied from the controller
        to the managed node and a mode is set, the mode is now applied to the directory
        on the controller. If the directory being copied contains files and mode is
        set, mode will only be applied to the files being copied not the pre-existing
        files.(https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_copy - fixes a bug where options were not defined in the module argument
        spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` 2.11 and using
        options `force` or `mode`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_fetch - fixes a bug where an option was not defined in the module argument
        spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` 2.11 and using
        option `encoding`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_job_submit - fixes a bug where an option was not defined in the module

        using option `encoding`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/462)
      - zos_ssh - fixes connection plugin which will error when using `ansible-core`
        2.11 with an `AttributeError module 'ansible.constants' has no attribute 'ANSIBLE_SSH_CONTROL_PATH_DIR'`.

    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - zos_copy - enhanced to optimize how it captures the permission bits state
        for the `dest`. This change now reviews the source files instead of traversing
        the entire `dest` path. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/561)
      - zos_copy - enhanced to support creating a parent directory when it does not
        exist in the `dest` path. Prior to this change, if a parent directory anywhere
        in the path did not exist the task would fail as it was stated in documentation.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/561)
      - "zos_copy - enhanced to support system symbols in PARMLIB. System symbols
        are elements that allow different z/OS\xAE systems to share PARMLIB definitions
        while retaining unique values in those definitions. This was fixed in a future
        release through the use of one of the ZOAU dependency but this version of
        `ibm_zos_core` does not support that dependency version so this support was
        added. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/566)"

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_job_output was updated to correct possible truncated responses for the
        ddname content. This would occur for jobs with very large amounts of content
        from a ddname.
      - "zos_ssh - connection plugin was updated to correct a bug in Ansible that\n

      deprecated_features:
      - zos_copy and zos_fetch option sftp_port has been deprecated. To set the SFTP
        port, use the supported options in the ansible.builtin.ssh plugin. Refer to
        the `SSH port <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/ssh_connection.html#parameter-port>`__
        option to configure the port used during the modules SFTP transport.
      - zos_copy module option model_ds has been removed. The model_ds logic is now
        automatically managed and data sets are either created based on the src data
        set or overridden by the new option destination_dataset.
      - zos_ssh connection plugin has been removed, it is no longer required. You
        must remove all playbook references to connection ibm.ibm_zos_core.zos_ssh.
      major_changes:
      - zos_copy was updated to support the ansible.builtin.ssh connection options;
        for further reference refer to the SSH plugin documentation.
      - zos_copy was updated to take into account the record length when the source
        is a USS file and the destination is a data set with a record length. This
        is done by inspecting the destination data set attributes and using these
        attributes to create a new data set.
      - zos_copy was updated with the capabilities to define destination data sets
        from within the zos_copy module. In the case where you are copying to a data
        set destination that does not exist, you can now do so using the new zos_copy
        module option destination.
      - zos_fetch was updated to support the ansible.builtin.ssh connection options;
        for further reference refer to the SSH plugin documentation.
      - zos_job_output was updated to to include the completion code (CC) for each
        individual job step as part of the ret_code response.
      - zos_job_query was updated to handle when an invalid job ID or job name is
        used with the module and returns a proper response.
      - zos_job_query was updated to support a 7 digit job number ID for when there
        are greater than 99,999 jobs in the history.
      - zos_job_submit was enhanced to check for 'JCL ERROR' when jobs are submitted
        and result in a proper module response.
      - zos_job_submit was updated to fail fast when a submitted job fails instead
        of waiting a predetermined time.
      - zos_operator_action_query response messages were improved with more diagnostic
        information in the event an error is encountered.
      - zos_ping was updated to remove the need for the zos_ssh connection plugin
        dependency.

        is set, mode will only be applied to the files being copied not the pre-existing
        files. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
      - zos_copy - fixes a bug where options were not defined in the module argument
        spec that will result in error when running `ansible-core` v2.11 and using
        options `force` or `mode`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/496)
      - zos_copy - introduced an updated creation policy referred to as precedence
        rules such that if `dest_data_set` is set, this will take precedence. If `dest`
        is an empty data set, the empty data set will be written with the expectation
        its attributes satisfy the copy. If no precedent rule has been exercised,
        `dest` will be created with the same attributes of `src`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
      - zos_copy - introduced new computation capabilities such that if `dest` is
        a nonexistent data set, the attributes assigned will depend on the type of
        `src`. If `src` is a USS file, `dest` will have a Fixed Block (FB) record
        format and the remaining attributes will be computed. If `src` is binary,
        `dest` will have a Fixed Block (FB) record format with a record length of
        80, block size of 32760, and the remaining attributes will be computed. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
      - zos_copy - option `dest_dataset` has been deprecated and removed in favor
        of the new option `dest_data_set`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/306)
      - zos_copy - was enhanced for when `src` is a directory and ends with "/", the
        contents of it will be copied into the root of `dest`. It it doesn't end with
        "/", the directory itself will be copied. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/496)

  1.5.0-beta.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug such that the module fails when copying files from
        a directory needing also to be encoded. The failure would also delete the
        `src` which was not desirable behavior. Fixes deletion of src on encoding
        error. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/321).
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug where copying a member from a loadlib to another loadlib
        fails. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/640)
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug where if a destination has accented characters in its
        content, the module would fail when trying to determine if it is empty. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/634)
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug where the computed record length for a new destination
        dataset would include newline characters. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/620)
      - zos_copy - Fixes wrongful creation of destination backups when module option
        `force` is true, creating emergency backups meant to restore the system to
        its initial state in case of a module failure only when force is false. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/590)
      - zos_copy - module was updated to correct a bug in the case when the destination
        (dest) is a PDSE and the source (src) is a Unix Systems File (USS). The module
        would fail in determining if the PDSE actually existed and try to create it
        when it already existed resulting in an error that would prevent the module
        from correctly executing. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/327)
      - zos_data_set - Fixes a bug such that the module will delete a catalogued data
        set over an uncatalogued data set even though the volume is provided for the
        uncataloged data set. This is unexpected behavior and does not align to documentation;
        correct behavior is that when a volume is provided that is the first place
        the module should look for the data set, whether or not it is cataloged. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/325).
      - zos_data_set - Fixes a bug where the default record format FB was actually
        never enforced and when enforced it would cause VSAM creation to fail with
        a Dynalloc failure. Also cleans up some of the options that are set by default
        when they have no bearing for batch. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/647)
      - zos_fetch - Updates the modules behavior when fetching VSAM data sets such
        that the maximum record length is now determined when creating a temporary
        data set to copy the VSAM data into and a variable-length (VB) data set is
        used. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/350)
      - zos_job_output - Fixes a bug that returned all ddname's when a specific ddnamae
        was provided. Now a specific ddname can be returned and all others ignored.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/334)
      - zos_job_query - was updated to correct a boolean condition that always evaluated
        to "CANCELLED". (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - zos_mount - Fixes option `tag_ccsid` to correctly allow for type int. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/511)
      - zos_mvs_raw - module was updated to correct a bug when no DD statements were
        provided. The module when no option was provided for `dds` would error, a
        default was provided to correct this behavior. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/336)
      - zos_operator - Fixes case sensitive error checks, invalid, error & unidentifiable
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - Fixes such that specifying wait_time_s would throw an error
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - Fixes the wait_time_s to default to 1 second (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - was updated to correct missing verbosity content when the option
        verbose was set to True. zos_operator - was updated to correct the trailing
        lines that would appear in the result content. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/400).
      deprecated_features:
      - zos_encode - deprecates the module options `from_encoding` and `to_encoding`
        to use suboptions `from` and `to` in order to remain consistent with all other
        modules. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/345).
      - zos_job_submit - Response 'message' property has been deprecated, all responses
        are now in response property 'msg'. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_job_submit - The 'wait' option has been deprecated because using option
        'wait_time_s' implies the job is going to wait. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      major_changes:
      - ibm_zos_core - Updates the entire collection in that the collection no longer
        depends on the managed node having installed System Display and Search Facility
        (SDSF). Remove SDSF dependency from ibm_zos_core collection. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/303).
      minor_changes:
      - module utility jobs - was updated to remove the usage of REXX and replaced
        with ZOAU python APIs. This reduces code replication and it removes the need
        for REXX interpretation which increases performance. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - module utils backup - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq.
        This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ)
        used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults
        are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - module utils dd_statement- updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq.
        This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ)
        used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults
        are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - module utils encode - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq.
        This allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ)
        used in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults
        are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_apf - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_blockinfile - fixes a bug when using double quotes in the block text of
        the module. When double quotes appeared in block text, the module would error
        differently depending on the usage of option insertafter. Examples of this
        error have return code 1 or 16 along with message "ZOAU dmod return content
        is NOT in json format" and a varying stderr. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/303).
      - zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named force. This allows
        for a user to specify that the data set can be shared with others during an
        update which results in the data set you are updating to be simultaneously
        updated by others. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/316).
      - zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named indentation.
        This allows for a user to specify a number of spaces to prepend to the content
        before being inserted into the destination. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/317).
      - zos_blockinfile - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This
        allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used
        in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not
        permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_copy - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_data_set - Ensures that temporary datasets created by zos_data_set use
        the tmp_hlq specified. This allows for a user to specify the data set high
        level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module.
        Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override
        the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/491).
      - zos_encode - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_fetch - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_gather_facts - is a new module that can discover facts about the managed
        z/OS target. This module leverages the zinfo utility offered by ZOAU. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/322).
      - zos_job_output - was updated to leverage the latest changes that removes the
        REXX code by calling the module utility jobs. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - zos_job_query - was updated to leverage the latest changes that removes the
        REXX code by calling the module utility jobs. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - zos_job_query - was updated to use the jobs module utility. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312).
      - zos_job_submit - The architecture changed such that the entire modules execution
        time now captured in the duration time which includes job submission and log
        collection. If a job does not return by the default 10 sec 'wait_time_s' value,
        it can be increased up to 86400 seconds. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_job_submit - behavior changed when a volume is defined in the module options
        such that it will catalog the data set if it is not cataloged and submit the
        job. In the past, the function did not catalog the data set and instead performed
        I/O operations and then submitted the job. This behavior aligns to other module
        behaviors and reduces the possibility to encounter a permissions issue. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_job_submit - was updated to include an additional error code condition
        JCLERR. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/312)
      - zos_lineinfile - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This
        allows for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used
        in any temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not
        permitted on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_mount - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_mvs_raw - Ensures that temporary datasets created by DD Statements use
        the tmp_hlq specified. This allows for a user to specify the data set high
        level qualifier (HLQ) used in any temporary data set created by the module.
        Often, the defaults are not permitted on systems, this provides a way to override
        the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/414).
      - zos_mvs_raw - updates the module with a new option named tmp_hlq. This allows
        for a user to specify the data set high level qualifier (HLQ) used in any
        temporary data set created by the module. Often, the defaults are not permitted
        on systems, this provides a way to override the defaults. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/341).
      - zos_operator - added in the response the cmd result (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - added in the response the elapsed time (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - added in the response the wait_time_s set (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - deprecated the wait option, not needed with wait_time_s minor_changes
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
      - zos_operator - was updated to remove the usage of REXX and replaced with ZOAU

    release_date: '2022-11-02'
  1.6.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - module_utils - data_set.py - Reported a failure caused when cataloging a VSAM
        data set. Fix now corrects how VSAM data sets are cataloged. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/816).
      - zos_copy - Encoding normalization used to handle newlines in text files was
        applied to binary files too. Fix makes sure that binary files bypass this
        normalization. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/810)
      - zos_copy - Reported a warning about the use of _play_context.verbosity.This
        change corrects the module action to prevent the warning message. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/814).
      - zos_copy - kept permissions on target directory when copy overwrote files.
        The fix now set permissions when mode is given. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/790)
      - zos_data_set - Reported a failure caused when `present=absent` for a VSAM
        data set leaving behind cluster components. Fix introduces a new logical flow
        that will evaluate the volumes, compare it to the provided value and if necessary
        catalog and delete. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/816).
      - zos_fetch - Reported a warning about the use of _play_context.verbosity.This
        change corrects the module action to prevent the warning message. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/814).
      - zos_gather_facts - Fixes an issue in the zoau version checker which prevented
        the zos_gather_facts module from running with newer versions of ZOAU. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/797)

  1.6.0-beta.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed wrong error message when a USS source is not found, aligning with a
        similar error message from zos_blockinfile "{src} does not exist".
      - zos_blockinfile - was unable to use double quotes which prevented some use
        cases and did not display an approriate message. The fix now allows for double
        quotes to be used with the module. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/680)
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug where files not encoded in IBM-1047 would trigger an
        error while computing the record length for a new destination dataset. Issue
        664. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/743)
      - zos_copy - Fixes a bug where the code for fixing an issue with newlines in
        files (issue 599) would use the wrong encoding for normalization. Issue 678.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/743)
      - zos_encode - fixes a bug where converted files were not tagged afterwards
        with the new code set. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/534)
      - zos_find - fixes a bug where find result values stopped being returned after
        first value in a list was 'not found'. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/668)
      - zos_lineinfile - Fixed a bug where a Python f-string was used and thus removed
        to ensure support for Python 2.7 on the controller. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/659)
      major_changes:
      - zos_volume_init - Introduces new module to handle volume (or minidisk) initialization.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/654)
      minor_changes:
      - Updated the text converter import from "from ansible.module_utils._text" to
        "from ansible.module_utils.common.text.converters" to remove warning".. warn
        Use ansible.module_utils.common.text.converters instead.". (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/602)
      - module_utils - job.py utility did not support positional wiled card placement,
        this enhancement uses `fnmatch` logic to support wild cards.
      - zos_copy - Fixed a bug where the module would change the mode for a directory
        when copying into it the contents of another. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/723)
      - zos_copy - was enhanced to keep track of modified members in a destination
        dataset, restoring them to their previous state in case of a failure. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/551)
      - zos_data_set - add force parameter to enable member delete while pdse is in
        use (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/718).
      - zos_job_query - ansible module does not support positional wild card placement
        for `job_name1 or `job_id`. This enhancement allows embedded wildcards throughout
        the `job_name` and `job_id`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/721)
      - zos_lineinfile - would access data sets with exclusive access so no other
        task can read the data, this enhancement allows for a data set to be opened
        with a disposition set to share so that other tasks can access the data when
        option `force` is set to `true`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/731)
      - zos_tso_command - was enhanced to accept `max_rc` as an option. This option
        allows a non-zero return code to succeed as a valid return code. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/666)

      - module_utils - data_set.py - Reported a failure caused when cataloging a VSAM
        data set. Fix now corrects how VSAM data sets are cataloged. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/791).
      - zos_blockinfile - Test case generate a data set that was not correctly removed.
        Changes delete the correct data set not only member. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/840)
      - zos_copy - Module returned the dynamic values created with the same dataset
        type and record format. Fix validate the correct dataset type and record format
        of target created. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/824)
      - zos_copy - Reported a false positive such that the response would have `changed=true`
        when copying from a source (src) or destination (dest) data set that was in
        use (DISP=SHR). This change now displays an appropriate error message and
        returns `changed=false`. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/794).
      - zos_copy - Reported a warning about the use of _play_context.verbosity.This
        change corrects the module action to prevent the warning message. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/806).
      - zos_copy - Test case for recursive encoding directories reported a UTF-8 failure.
        This change ensures proper test coverage for nested directories and file permissions.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/806).
      - zos_copy - Zos_copy did not encode inner content inside subdirectories once
        the source was copied to the destination. Fix now encodes all content in a
        source directory, including subdirectories. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/772).
      - zos_copy - kept permissions on target directory when copy overwrote files.
        The fix now set permissions when mode is given. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/795)
      - zos_data_set - Reported a failure caused when `present=absent` for a VSAM
        data set leaving behind cluster components. Fix introduces a new logical flow
        that will evaluate the volumes, compare it to the provided value and if necessary
        catalog and delete. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/791).

        change corrects the module action to prevent the warning message. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/806).
      - zos_job_output - Error message did not specify the job not found. Fix now
        specifies the job_id or job_name being searched to ensure more information
        is given back to the user. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/747)
      - zos_operator - Reported a failure caused by unrelated error response. Fix
        now gives a transparent response of the operator to avoid false negatives.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/762).
      major_changes:
      - zos_copy - Previously, backups were taken when force was set to false; whether
        or not a user specified this operation which caused allocation issues with
        space and permissions. This removes the automatic backup performed and reverts
        to the original logic in that backups must be initiated by the user. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/896)
      minor_changes:
      - Add support for Jinja2 templates in zos_copy and zos_job_submit when using
        local source files. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/667)
      - zos_copy - Adds block_size, record_format, record_length, space_primary, space_secondary,
        space_type and type in the return output when the destination data set does
        not exist and has to be created by the module. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/773)
      - zos_data_set - record format = 'F' has been added to support 'fixed' block
        records. This allows records that can use the entire block. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/821)
      - zos_job_output - zoau added 'program_name' to their field output starting
        with v1.2.4.  This enhancement checks for that version and passes the extra
        column through. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/841)
      - zos_job_query - Adds new fields job_class, svc_class, priority, asid, creation_datetime,
        and queue_position to the return output when querying or submitting a job.
        Available when using ZOAU v1.2.3 or greater. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/778)
      - zos_job_query - unnecessary calls were made to find a jobs DDs that incurred
        unnecessary overhead. This change removes those resulting in a performance
        increase in job related queries. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/911)
      - zos_job_query - zoau added 'program_name' to their field output starting with
        v1.2.4.  This enhancement checks for that version and passes the extra column

    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_copy - When copying an executable data set from controller to managed
        node, copy operation failed with an encoding error. Fix now avoids encoding
        when executable option is selected. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1079).
      - zos_copy - When copying an executable data set with aliases and destination
        did not exist, destination data set was created with wrong attributes. Fix
        now creates destination data set with the same attributes as the source. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1067).
      - zos_copy - When performing a copy operation to an existing file, the copied
        file resulted in having corrupted contents. Fix now implements a workaround
        to not use the specific copy routine that corrupts the file contents. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1069).
      - zos_operator - The module was ignoring the wait time argument. The module
        now passes the wait time argument to ZOAU. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1063).
      - zos_operator_action_query - The module was ignoring the wait time argument.
        The module now passes the wait time argument to ZOAU. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1063).
      - zos_unarchive - When zos_unarchive fails during unpack either with xmit or
        terse it does not clean the temporary data sets created. Fix now removes the
        temporary data sets. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1054).
      minor_changes:
      - zos_script - Add support for remote_tmp from the Ansible configuration to
        setup where temporary files will be created, replacing the module option tmp_path.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1068).
      - zos_job_submit - Previous code did not return output, but still requested
        job data from the target system. This changes to honor return_output=false
        by not querying the job dd segments at all. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1063).
      - zos_tso_command - Add example for executing explicitly a REXX script from
        a data set. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1072).

  1.8.0-beta.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zos_copy - Update option limit to include LIBRARY as dest_dataset/suboption
        value. Documentation updated to reflect this change. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/968).
      - zos_job_submit - Temporary files were created in tmp directory. Fix now ensures
        the deletion of files every time the module run. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/951)
      - zos_job_submit - The last line of the jcl was missing in the input. Fix now
        ensures the presence of the full input in job_submit. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/952)
      - zos_lineinfile - A duplicate entry was made even if line was already present
        in the target file. Fix now prevents a duplicate entry if the line already
        exists in the target file. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/916)
      - zos_operator - The last line of the operator was missing in the response of
        the module. The fix now ensures the presence of the full output of the operator.
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/918)
      deprecated_features:
      - zos_blockinfile debug - is deprecated in favor of 'as_json' (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/904).
      known_issues:
      - Several modules have reported UTF8 decoding errors when interacting with results
        that contain non-printable UTF8 characters in the response. This occurs when
        a module receives content that does not correspond to a UTF-8 value. These
        include modules `zos_job_submit`, `zos_job_output`, `zos_operator_action_query`
        but are not limited to this list. This will be addressed in `ibm_zos_core`
        version 1.10.0-beta.1. Each case is unique, some options to work around the
        error are below. - Specify that the ASA assembler option be enabled to instruct
        the assembler to use ANSI control characters instead of machine code control
        characters. - Add `ignore_errors:true` to the playbook task so the task error
        will not fail the playbook. - If the error is resulting from a batch job,
        add `ignore_errors:true` to the task and capture the output into a variable
        and extract the job ID with a regular expression and then use `zos_job_output`
        to display the DD without the non-printable character such as the DD `JESMSGLG`.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/677) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/776)
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/972)
      - With later versions of `ansible-core` used with `ibm_zos_core` collection
        a warning has started to appear "Module "ansible.builtin.command" returned
        non UTF-8 data in the JSON response" that is currently being reviewed. There
        are no recommendations at this point. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/983)
      minor_changes:
      - module_utils/template - Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized
        path traversals. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1029)
      - zos_archive - Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path traversals.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1029)
      - zos_archive - Enhanced test cases to use test lines the same length of the
        record length. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/965)
      - zos_copy -  Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path traversals.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/962)
      - zos_copy - Add new option `force_lock` that can copy into data sets that are
        already in use by other processes (DISP=SHR). User needs to use with caution
        because this is subject to race conditions and can lead to data loss. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/980).
      - zos_copy - includes a new option `executable` that enables copying of executables
        such as load modules or program objects to both USS and partitioned data sets.
        When the `dest` option contains a non-existent data set, `zos_copy` will create
        a data set with the appropriate attributes for an executable. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/804)
      - zos_copy - introduces a new option 'aliases' to enable preservation of member
        aliases when copying data to partitioned data sets (PDS) destinations from
        USS or other PDS sources. Copying aliases of text based members to/from USS
        is not supported. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1014)
      - zos_fetch - Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path traversals.
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/962)
      - zos_job_submit - Change action plugin call from copy to zos_copy. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/951)
      - zos_operator - Changed system to call 'wait=true' parameter to zoau call.
        Requires zoau 1.2.5 or later. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/976)
      - zos_operator_action_query - Add a max delay of 5 seconds on each part of the
        operator_action_query. Requires zoau 1.2.5 or later. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/976)
      - zos_unarchive -  Add validation into path joins to detect unauthorized path
        traversals. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1029)
      - zos_unarchive - Enhanced test cases to use test lines the same length of the
        record length. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/965)
