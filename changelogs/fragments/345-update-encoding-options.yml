deprecated_features:
- zos_encode - deprecates the module options `from_encoding` and
  `to_encoding` to use suboptions `from` and `to` in order to remain
  consistent with all other modules.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/345).
- zos_job_submit - The 'wait' option has been deprecated because using
  option 'wait_time_s' implies the job is going to wait.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/issues/389).
- zos_job_submit - Response 'message' property has been deprecated, all responses
  are now in response property 'msg'.
