minor_changes:
- zos_copy - zos_copy create data sets that not exist but the return output 
  did  not included dynamic values created as Return the values of block_size, 
  record_format, record_length, space_primary, space_secondary, space_type 
  and type. The minor_change adds the MVS data set attributes of a dynamically 
  created destination in the return output.
