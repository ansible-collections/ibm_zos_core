Roles
=======

Roles are ways of automatically loading certain vars_files, tasks, and
handlers based on a known file structure.
Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.

The **IBM z/OS core** provides several roles.
Reference material for each role contains documentation on how to use certain
roles in your playbook.
