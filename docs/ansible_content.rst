z/OS Core
=========

The **IBM z/OS core collection**, also represented as **ibm\_zos\_core**
in this document, is part of the broader offering **Red Hat® Ansible
Certified Content for IBM Z**. IBM z/OS core collection supports tasks
such as creating data sets, submitting jobs, querying jobs,
retrieving job output, encoding data sets, fetching data sets, operator
commands, TSO commands, ping and querying operator actions.

The **IBM z/OS core collection** serves as a dependency for other collections
under the **Red Hat® Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** umbrella and
works closely with offerings such as `IBM z/OS IMS collection`_ to deliver
a solution that will enable you to automate tasks on z/OS subsystems such
as IMS.
