bugfixes:
   - zos_data_set - Attempting to create a data set with the same name on a 
     different volume did not work, nor did it report a failure. 
     The fix now informs the user that if the data set is cataloged on a 
     different volume and it needs to be uncataloged before using the data 
     set module to create a new data set on a different volume.

trivial:     
   - data_set - added validation logic to compare requested volumes against
     cataloged volumes.
