Playbooks
=========

An `Ansible playbook`_ consists of organized instructions that define work for
a managed node (host) to be managed with Ansible.

If you would like to try a collection, use one of the many sample playbooks
available in our samples repository contributed by the
**Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z** team. The `samples repository`_
explains the playbook concepts, discusses z/OS administration, provides links to
the samples support site, blogs and other community resources.
