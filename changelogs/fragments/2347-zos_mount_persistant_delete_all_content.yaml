bugfixes:
  - zos_mount - Previously, using the persistent parameter caused the module to clear the entire member or data set
    provided even without a pattern match, leaving it empty despite a successful mount.
    The fix now ensures content is only deleted when a pattern match is detected, preserving existing configuration.
