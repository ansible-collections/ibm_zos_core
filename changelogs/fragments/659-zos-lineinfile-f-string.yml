bugfixes:
- zos_lineinfile - Fixed a bug where a Python f-string was used and thus removed
  to ensure support for Python 2.7 on the controller.
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/659)
trivial:
- Remove changelog fragments no longer needed as they are already recorded in
  the prior version of IBM z/OS Core.
