============
Requirements
============

The **IBM z/OS core collection** requires both a **control node** and
**managed node** be configured with a minimum set of requirements. The
control node is often referred to as the **controller** and the
managed node as the **host**.

Control node
============
The controller is where the Ansible engine that runs the playbook is installed.
Refer to RedHat Ansible Certified Content documentation for more on the `controllers dependencies`_.
