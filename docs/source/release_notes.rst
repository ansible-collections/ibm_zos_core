Version 1.15.0
==============

Minor Changes
-------------

- ``zos_archive``

   - Adds support for encoding before archiving files.
   - Adds support for skipping encoding in archive module. This allows users to skip encoding for certain files before archiving them.
   - Adds support for reverting the encoding of a source's files after archiving them.

- ``zos_copy``

   - Adds new option `identical_gdg_copy` in the module. This allows copying GDG generations from a source base to a destination base while preserving generation data set absolute names when the destination base does not exist prior to the copy.
   - Adds support of using alias names in src and dest parameters for PS, PDS and PDSE data sets.
   - Added support for british pound character usage in file content and data set names for both source and destination when copying.

- ``zos_fetch`` - Updated the documentation to correctly state what the default behavior of the module is.
- ``zos_find``

   - Adds functionality to find migrated data sets.
   - Adds functionality to find different types of data sets at the same time.

- ``zos_job_output`` - Adds new fields cpu_time, origin_node and execution_node to response.
- ``zos_job_query`` - Adds new fields cpu_time, origin_node and execution_node to response.
- ``zos_job_submit`` - Adds new fields cpu_time, origin_node and execution_node to response.

- ``zos_mvs_raw``

   - Before this addition, you could not put anything in columns 1 or 2, were reserved for JCL processing. Change now allows add reserved_cols option and validate that the module get access to modify dd_content option base on the value, if not retain the previous behavior or work.
   - Adds support for volume data definition.

- ``zos_stat``

   - Added support to recall migrated data sets and return its attributes.
   - Adds new fields that describe the type of the resource that was queried. These new fields are ``isfile``, ``isdataset``, ``isaggregate`` and ``isgdg``.
   - Adds support to query data sets using their aliases.
   - Module now returns whether the resource queried exists on the managed node with the `exists` field inside `stat`.

- ``zos_unarchive`` - Added encoding support in the zos_unarchive module. This allows users to encode the files after unarchiving them.

Bugfixes
--------
- ``zos_backup_restore`` - Return value ``backup_name`` was empty upon successful result. Fix now returns ``backup_name`` populated.
- ``zos_data_set`` - Attempting to create a data set with the same name on a different volume did not work, nor did it report a failure. The fix now informs the user that if the data set is cataloged on a different volume, it needs to be uncataloged before using the data set module to create a new data set on a different volume.
- ``zos_fetch`` - Previously, the use of `become` would result in a permissions error  while trying to fetch a data set or a member. Fix now allows a user to escalate privileges when fetching resources.
- ``zos_lineinfile``

   - Return values ``return_content`` and ``backup_name`` were not always being returned. Fix now ensure that these values are always present in the module's response.
   - The module would report a false negative when certain special characters where present in the `line` option. Fix now reports the successful operation.

- ``zos_mount`` - FSUMF168 return in stderror means that the mount dataset wouldn't resolve. While this shows a catalog or volume issue, it should not impact our search for an existing mount. Added handling to the df call, so that FSUMF168 are ignored.

Version 1.14.0
==============

Minor Changes
-------------

   - Adds logging of Jinja rendered template content when `use_template` is true and verbosity level `-vvv` is used.
   - Adds support for copying in asynchronous mode inside playbooks.
   - Removes the need to allow READ access to MVS.MCSOPER.ZOAU to execute the module by changing how the module checks if a data set is locked.
   - Previously, when trying to copy into remote and ansible's default temporary directory was not created before execution the copy task would fail. Fix now creates the temporary directory if possible.

- ``zos_job_output`` - Add execution_time return value in the modules response.
- ``zos_job_query``

   - Add execution_time return value in the modules response.
   - Loads correct bytes size value for dds when using zoau 1.3.4 or later
   - System and Subsystem are now retrieved from JES.

- ``zos_job_submit``

   - Adds logging of Jinja rendered template content when `use_template` is true and verbosity level `-vvv` is used.
   - Add execution_time return value in the modules response.
   - Loads correct bytes size value for dds when using zoau 1.3.4 or later.
   - Previously, the use of `become` would result in a permissions error while trying to execute a job from a local file. Fix now allows a user to escalate privileges when executing a job transferred from the controller node.

- ``zos_zfs_resize`` - Adds validations for trace destination dataset used for trace verbose.

Bugfixes
--------

- ``zos_apf`` - When trying to add a library into the APF list that was already added, the module would fail. Fix now will not fail the module, and will inform the user that the library is already on the APF list.
- ``zos_copy``

   - Previously, if the dataset name included special characters such as $, validation would fail when force_lock was false. This has been changed to allow the use of special characters when force_lock option is false.    - When ``asa_text`` was set to true at the same time as ``force_lock``, a copy would fail saying the destination was already in use. Fix now opens destination data sets up with disposition SHR when ``force_lock`` and ``asa_text`` are set to true.
   - the carriage return characters were being removed from only first 1024 bytes of a file. Now fixed that issue to support removal of the carriage return characters from the complete file content if the file size is more than 1024 bytes.

- ``zos_data_set``

   - Module would fail when trying to delete a non-existent Generation Data Group. Fix now provides a successful response with `changed=false`.
   - Module would fail with TypeError when trying to replace an existing GDG. Fix now allows to replacing a GDG.

Version 1.13.0
==============

Minor Changes
-------------

- ``zos_copy``

   - Added new option ``autoescape`` to ``template_parameters``, allowing users to disable autoescaping of common XML/HTML characters when working with Jinja templates.
   - Adds error message when a PDS/E source member does not exist or is not cataloged.

- ``zos_job_submit``

   - Add deploy and forget capability. Now when wait_time_s is 0, the module will submit the job and will not wait to get the job details or content, returning only the job id.
   - Added new option ``autoescape`` to ``template_parameters``, allowing users to disable autoescaping of common XML/HTML characters when working with Jinja templates.
   - Added support to run zos_job_submit tasks in async mode inside playbooks.

- ``zos_mvs_raw`` - Added ``max_rc`` option. Now when the user sets ``max_rc``, the module tolerates the failure if the return code is smaller than the ``max_rc`` specified, however, return value ``changed`` will be False if the program return code is not 0.
- ``zos_script`` - Added new option ``autoescape`` to ``template_parameters``, allowing users to disable autoescaping of common XML/HTML characters when working with Jinja templates.

Bugfixes
--------

- ``zos_copy``

   - Improve module zos_copy error handling when the user does not have universal access authority set to UACC(READ) for SAF Profile 'MVS.MCSOPER.ZOAU' and SAF Class OPERCMDS. The module now handles the exception and returns an informative message.
   - Previously, if the dataset name included special characters such as $, validation would fail when force_lock was false. This has been changed to allow the use of special characters when force_lock option is false.
   - Previously, if the dataset name included special characters such as ``$`` and ``asa_text`` option is true, the module would fail. Fix now allows the use of special characters in the data set name when ``asa_text`` option is true.
   - When ``asa_text`` was set to true at the same time as ``force_lock``, a copy would fail saying the destination was already in use. Fix now opens destination data sets up with disposition SHR when ``force_lock`` and ``asa_text`` are set to true.

- ``zos_fetch`` - Some relative paths were not accepted as a parameter e.g. C(files/fetched_file). Change now allows the user to use different types of relative paths as a parameter.
- ``zos_find``

   - Module would not find VSAM data and index resource types. Fix now finds the data and index resource types.
   - Module would not find a VSAM cluster resource type if it was in use with DISP=OLD. Fix now finds the VSAM cluster.

- ``zos_job_query`` - Module was not returning values for system and subsystem. Fix now returns these values.
- ``zos_mvs_raw``

   - If a program failed with a non-zero return code and verbose was false, the module would succeed. Whereas, if the program failed and verbose was true the module would fail. Fix now has a consistent behavior and fails in both cases.
   - Module would not populate stderr return value. Fix now populates stderr in return values.
   - Module would obfuscate the return code from the program when failing returning 8 instead. Fix now returns the proper return code from the program.
   - Module would return the stderr content in stdout when verbose was true and return code was 0. Fix now does not replace stdout content with stderr.
   - Option ``tmp_hlq`` was not being used as HLQ when creating backup data sets. Fix now uses ``tmp_hlq`` as HLQ for backup data sets.

- ``zos_script`` - When the user trying to run a remote script had execute permissions but wasn't owner of the file, the module would fail while trying to change permissions on it. Fix now ensures the module first checks if the user can execute the script and only try to change permissions when necessary.

Porting Guide
-------------

This section discusses the behavioral changes between ``ibm_zos_core`` v1.9.0 and ``ibm_zos_core`` v1.10.0-beta.1.
It is intended to assist in updating your playbooks so this collection will continue to work.

- ``zos_archive``

Known Issues
------------
- ``zos_job_submit`` - when setting 'location' to 'local' and not specifying the from and to encoding, the modules defaults are not read leaving the file in its original encoding; explicitly set the encodings instead of relying on the default.
- ``zos_job_submit`` - when submitting JCL, the response value returned for **byte_count** is incorrect.
- ``zos_data_set`` - When data set creation fails, exception can throw a bad import error instead of data set creation error.
- ``zos_copy`` - To use this module, you must define the RACF FACILITY class profile and allow READ access to RACF FACILITY profile MVS.MCSOPER.ZOAU. If your system uses a different security product, consult that product's documentation to configure the required security classes.
- ``zos_job_submit``, ``zos_job_output``, ``zos_operator_action_query`` - encounters JSON decoding (DecodeError, TypeError, KeyError) errors when interacting with results that contain non-printable UTF-8 characters in the response. This will be addressed in **ZOAU version 1.3.2** and later.

   - Some options to work around this known issue are:

      - Specify that the ASA assembler option be enabled to instruct the assembler to use ANSI control characters instead of machine code control characters.
      - Ignore module errors by using  **ignore_errors:true** for a specific playbook task.
      - If the error is resulting from a batch job, add **ignore_errors:true** to the task and capture the output into a registered variable to extract the
        job ID with a regular expression. Then use ``zos_job_output`` to display the DD without the non-printable character such as the DD **JESMSGLG**.
      - If the error is the result of a batch job, set option **return_output** to false so that no DDs are read which could contain the non-printable UTF-8 characters.

- In the past, choices could be defined in either lower or upper case. Now, only the case that is identified in the docs can be set, this is so that the collection can continue to maintain certified status.
- Use of special characters (#, @, $, \- ) in different options like data set names and commands is not fully supported, some modules support them but is the user responsibility to escape them. Read each module documentation for further details.
