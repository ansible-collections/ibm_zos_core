minor_changes:
  - zos_job_submit - The module handling ZOAU import errors obscured the
    original traceback when an import error ocurred. Fix now passes correctly
    the context to the user.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ibm_zos_core/pull/1091).

  - zos_job_submit - The module had undocumented parameter and uses as temporary file
    when the location of the file is LOCAL. Change now uses the same name as the src
    for the temporary file removing the addition of tmp_file to the arguments.
