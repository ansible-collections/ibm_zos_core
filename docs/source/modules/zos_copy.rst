zos_copy -- Copy data to z/OS
=============================



.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------
- The `zos_copy <./zos_copy.html>`_ module copies a file or data set from a local or a remote machine to a location on the remote machine.





Parameters
----------


backup
  Specifies whether a backup of the destination should be created before copying data.

  When set to ``true``, the module creates a backup file or data set.

  The backup file name will be returned on either success or failure of module execution such that data can be retrieved.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


backup_name
  Specify a unique USS file name or data set name for the destination backup.

  If the destination ``dest`` is a USS file or path, the ``backup_name`` must be an absolute path name.

  If the destination is an MVS data set name, the ``backup_name`` provided must meet data set naming conventions of one or more qualifiers, each from one to eight characters long, that are delimited by periods.

  If the ``backup_name`` is not provided, the default ``backup_name`` will be used. If the ``dest`` is a USS file or USS path, the name of the backup file will be the destination file or path name appended with a timestamp, e.g. ``/path/file_name.2020-04-23-08-32-29-bak.tar``. If the ``dest`` is an MVS data set, it will be a data set with a randomly generated name.

  If ``dest`` is a data set member and ``backup_name`` is not provided, the data set member will be backed up to the same partitioned data set with a randomly generated member name.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


content
  When used instead of ``src``, sets the contents of a file or data set directly to the specified value.

  Works only when ``dest`` is a USS file, sequential data set, or a partitioned data set member.

  If ``dest`` is a directory, then content will be copied to ``/path/to/dest/inline_copy``.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


dest
  The remote absolute path or data set where the content should be copied to.

  ``dest`` can be a USS file, directory or MVS data set name.

  If ``dest`` has missing parent directories, they will be created.

  If ``dest`` is a nonexistent USS file, it will be created.

  If ``dest`` is a nonexistent data set, it will be created following the process outlined here and in the ``volume`` option.

  If ``dest`` is a nonexistent data set, the attributes assigned will depend on the type of ``src``. If ``src`` is a USS file, ``dest`` will have a Fixed Block (FB) record format and the remaining attributes will be computed. If ``src`` is binary, ``dest`` will have a Fixed Block (FB) record format with a record length of 80, block size of 32760, and the remaining attributes will be computed.

  When ``dest`` is a data set, precedence rules apply. If ``dest_data_set`` is set, this will take precedence over an existing data set. If ``dest`` is an empty data set, the empty data set will be written with the expectation its attributes satisfy the copy. Lastly, if no precendent rule has been exercised, ``dest`` will be created with the same attributes of ``src``.

  When the ``dest`` is an existing VSAM (KSDS) or VSAM (ESDS), then source can be an ESDS, a KSDS or an RRDS. The VSAM (KSDS) or VSAM (ESDS) ``dest`` will be deleted and recreated following the process outlined in the ``volume`` option.

  When the ``dest`` is an existing VSAM (RRDS), then the source must be an RRDS. The VSAM (RRDS) will be deleted and recreated following the process outlined in the ``volume`` option.

  When ``dest`` is and existing VSAM (LDS), then source must be an LDS. The VSAM (LDS) will be deleted and recreated following the process outlined in the ``volume`` option.

  When ``dest`` is a data set, you can override storage management rules by specifying ``volume`` if the storage class being used has GUARANTEED_SPACE=YES specified, otherwise, the allocation will fail. See ``volume`` for more volume related processes.

  | **required**: True
  | **type**: str


encoding
  Specifies which encodings the destination file or data set should be converted from and to.

  If ``encoding`` is not provided, the module determines which local and remote charsets to convert the data from and to. Note that this is only done for text data and not binary data.

  Only valid if ``is_binary`` is false.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: dict


  from
    The encoding to be converted from

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str


  to
    The encoding to be converted to

    | **required**: True
    | **type**: str



tmp_hlq
  Override the default high level qualifier (HLQ) for temporary and backup datasets.

  The default HLQ is the Ansible user used to execute the module and if that is not available, then the value ``TMPHLQ`` is used.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


force
  If set to ``true`` and the remote file or data set ``dest`` is empty, the ``dest`` will be reused.

  If set to ``true`` and the remote file or data set ``dest`` is NOT empty, the ``dest`` will be deleted and recreated with the ``src`` data set attributes, otherwise it will be recreated with the ``dest`` data set attributes.

  To backup data before any deletion, see parameters ``backup`` and ``backup_name``.

  If set to ``false``, the file or data set will only be copied if the destination does not exist.

  If set to ``false`` and destination exists, the module exits with a note to the user.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


ignore_sftp_stderr
  During data transfer through SFTP, the module fails if the SFTP command directs any content to stderr. The user is able to override this behavior by setting this parameter to ``true``. By doing so, the module would essentially ignore the stderr stream produced by SFTP and continue execution.

  When Ansible verbosity is set to greater than 3, either through the command line interface (CLI) using **-vvvv** or through environment variables such as **verbosity = 4**, then this parameter will automatically be set to ``true``.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


is_binary
  If set to ``true``, indicates that the file or data set to be copied is a binary file/data set.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


local_follow
  This flag indicates that any existing filesystem links in the source tree should be followed.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool
  | **default**: True


mode
  The permission of the destination file or directory.

  If ``dest`` is USS, this will act as Unix file mode, otherwise ignored.

  It should be noted that modes are octal numbers. The user must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like ``0644`` or ``01777``)or quote it (like ``'644'`` or ``'1777'``) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number. Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.

  The mode may also be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, ``u+rwx`` or ``u=rw,g=r,o=r``) or a special string `preserve`.

  *mode=preserve* means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


remote_src
  If set to ``false``, the module searches for ``src`` at the local machine.

  If set to ``true``, the module goes to the remote/target machine for ``src``.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


src
  Path to a file/directory or name of a data set to copy to remote z/OS system.

  If ``remote_src`` is true, then ``src`` must be the path to a Unix System Services (USS) file, name of a data set, or data set member.

  If ``src`` is a local path or a USS path, it can be absolute or relative.

  If ``src`` is a directory, ``dest`` must be a partitioned data set or a USS directory.

  If ``src`` is a file and ``dest`` ends with "/" or is a directory, the file is copied to the directory with the same filename as ``src``.

  If ``src`` is a directory and ends with "/", the contents of it will be copied into the root of ``dest``. If it doesn't end with "/", the directory itself will be copied.

  If ``src`` is a VSAM data set, ``dest`` must also be a VSAM.

  Wildcards can be used to copy multiple PDS/PDSE members to another PDS/PDSE.

  Required unless using ``content``.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


validate
  Specifies whether to perform checksum validation for source and destination files.

  Valid only for USS destination, otherwise ignored.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: bool


volume
  If ``dest`` does not exist, specify which volume ``dest`` should be allocated to.

  Only valid when the destination is an MVS data set.

  The volume must already be present on the device.

  If no volume is specified, storage management rules will be used to determine the volume where ``dest`` will be allocated.

  If the storage administrator has specified a system default unit name and you do not set a ``volume`` name for non-system-managed data sets, then the system uses the volumes associated with the default unit name. Check with your storage administrator to determine whether a default unit name has been specified.

  | **required**: False
  | **type**: str


dest_data_set
  Data set attributes to customize a ``dest`` data set to be copied into.

  | **required**: False

Notes
-----

.. note::
   Destination data sets are assumed to be in catalog. When trying to copy to an uncataloged data set, the module assumes that the data set does not exist and will create it.

   Destination will be backed up if either ``backup`` is ``true`` or ``backup_name`` is provided. If ``backup`` is ``false`` but ``backup_name`` is provided, task will fail.

   When copying local files or directories, temporary storage will be used on the remote z/OS system. The size of the temporary storage will correspond to the size of the file or directory being copied. Temporary files will always be deleted, regardless of success or failure of the copy task.

   VSAM data sets can only be copied to other VSAM data sets.

   For supported character sets used to encode data, refer to the `documentation <https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zos_core/docs/source/resources/character_set.html>`_.

   `zos_copy <./zos_copy.html>`_ uses SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for the underlying transfer protocol; Co:Z SFTP is not supported. In the case of Co:z SFTP, you can exempt the Ansible userid on z/OS from using Co:Z thus falling back to using standard SFTP.
