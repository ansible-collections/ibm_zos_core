module: zos_copy
version_added: '1.2.0'
short_description: Copy data to z/OS
description:
  - The L(zos_copy,./zos_copy.html) module copies a file or data set from a local or a
    remote machine to a location on the remote machine.

options:
  asa_text:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), indicates that either C(src) or C(dest) or both
        contain ASA control characters.
      - When C(src) is a USS file and C(dest) is a data set, the copy will
        preserve ASA control characters in the destination.
      - When C(src) is a data set containing ASA control characters and
        C(dest) is a USS file, the copy will put all control characters as
        plain text in the destination.
      - If C(dest) is a non-existent data set, it will be created with record
        format Fixed Block with ANSI format (FBA).
      - If neither C(src) or C(dest) have record format Fixed Block with ANSI
        format (FBA) or Variable Block with ANSI format (VBA), the module
        will fail.
      - This option is only valid for text files. If C(is_binary) is C(true)
        or C(executable) is C(true) as well, the module will fail.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  identical_gdg_copy:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), and the destination GDG does not exist, the module
        will copy the source GDG to the destination GDG with identical GDS absolute names.
      - If set to C(false), the copy will be done as a normal copy, without
        preserving the source GDG absolute names.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  backup:
    description:
      - Specifies whether a backup of the destination should be created before
        copying data.
      - When set to C(true), the module creates a backup file or data set.
      - The backup file name will be returned on either success or failure of
        module execution such that data can be retrieved.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  backup_name:
    description:
      - Specify a unique USS file name or data set name for the destination backup.
      - If the destination C(dest) is a USS file or path, the C(backup_name) must
        be an absolute path name.
      - If the destination is an MVS data set name, the C(backup_name) provided
        must meet data set naming conventions of one or more qualifiers, each
        from one to eight characters long, that are delimited by periods.
      - If the C(backup_name) is not provided, the default C(backup_name) will
        be used. If the C(dest) is a USS file or USS path, the name of the backup
        file will be the destination file or path name appended with a
        timestamp, e.g. C(/path/file_name.2020-04-23-08-32-29-bak.tar). If the
        C(dest) is an MVS data set, it will be a data set with a randomly generated
        name.
      - If C(dest) is a data set member and C(backup_name) is not provided, the data set
        member will be backed up to the same partitioned data set with a randomly
        generated member name.
      - If I(backup_name) is a generation data set (GDS), it must be a relative
        positive name (for example, V(HLQ.USER.GDG(+1\))).
    required: false
    type: str
  content:
    description:
      - When used instead of C(src), sets the contents of a file or data set
        directly to the specified value.
      - Works only when C(dest) is a USS file, sequential data set, or a
        partitioned data set member.
      - If C(dest) is a directory, then content will be copied to
        C(/path/to/dest/inline_copy).
    type: str
    required: false
  dest:
    description:
      - The remote absolute path or data set where the content should be copied to.
      - C(dest) can be a USS file, directory or MVS data set name.
      - C(dest) can be a alias name of a PS, PDS or PDSE data set.
      - If C(dest) has missing parent directories, they will be created.
      - If C(dest) is a nonexistent USS file, it will be created.
      - If C(dest) is a new USS file or replacement, the file will be appropriately tagged with
        either the system's default locale or the encoding option defined. If the USS file is
        a replacement, the user must have write authority to the file either through ownership,
        group or other permissions, else the module will fail.
      - If C(dest) is a nonexistent data set, it will be created following the
        process outlined here and in the C(volume) option.
      - If C(dest) is a nonexistent data set, the attributes assigned will depend on the type of
        C(src). If C(src) is a USS file, C(dest) will have a Fixed Block (FB) record format and the
        remaining attributes will be computed. If I(is_binary=true), C(dest) will have a Fixed Block
        (FB) record format with a record length of 80, block size of 32720, and the remaining
        attributes will be computed. If I(executable=true),C(dest) will have an Undefined (U) record
        format with a record length of 0, block size of 32760, and the remaining attributes will be
        computed.
      - If C(src) is a file and C(dest) a partitioned data set, C(dest) does not need to include
        a member in its value, the module can automatically compute the resulting member name from
        C(src).
      - When C(dest) is a data set, precedence rules apply. If C(dest_data_set)
        is set, this will take precedence over an existing data set. If C(dest)
        is an empty data set, the empty data set will be written with the
        expectation its attributes satisfy the copy. Lastly, if no precendent
        rule has been exercised, C(dest) will be created with the same attributes
        of C(src).
      - When the C(dest) is an existing VSAM (KSDS) or VSAM (ESDS), then source
        can be an ESDS, a KSDS or an RRDS. The VSAM (KSDS) or VSAM (ESDS) C(dest) will
        be deleted and recreated following the process outlined in the C(volume) option.
      - When the C(dest) is an existing VSAM (RRDS), then the source must be an RRDS.
        The VSAM (RRDS) will be deleted and recreated following the process outlined
       in the C(volume) option.
      - When C(dest) is and existing VSAM (LDS), then source must be an LDS. The
        VSAM (LDS) will be deleted and recreated following the process outlined
        in the C(volume) option.
      - C(dest) can be a previously allocated generation data set (GDS) or a new GDS.
      - When C(dest) is a generation data group (GDG), C(src) must be a GDG too. The copy
        will allocate successive new generations in C(dest), the module will verify
        it has enough available generations before starting the copy operations.
      - When C(dest) is a data set, you can override storage management rules
        by specifying C(volume) if the storage class being used has
        GUARANTEED_SPACE=YES specified, otherwise, the allocation will
        fail. See C(volume) for more volume related processes.
    type: str
    required: true
  encoding:
    description:
      - Specifies which encodings the destination file or data set should be
        converted from and to.
      - If C(encoding) is not provided, the module determines which local and remote
        charsets to convert the data from and to. Note that this is only done for text
        data and not binary data.
      - Only valid if C(is_binary) is false.
    type: dict
    required: false
    suboptions:
      from:

        required: false
        type: str
  tmp_hlq:
    description:
      - Override the default high level qualifier (HLQ) for temporary and backup
        datasets.
      - The default HLQ is the Ansible user used to execute the module and if
        that is not available, then the value C(TMPHLQ) is used.
    required: false
    type: str
  force:
    description:
      - If set to C(true) and the remote file or data set C(dest) is empty,
        the C(dest) will be reused.
      - If set to C(true) and the remote file or data set C(dest) is NOT empty,
        the C(dest) will be deleted and recreated with the C(src) data set
        attributes, otherwise it will be recreated with the C(dest) data set
        attributes.
      - To backup data before any deletion, see parameters C(backup) and
        C(backup_name).
      - If set to C(false), the file or data set will only be copied if the
        destination does not exist.
      - If set to C(false) and destination exists, the module exits with a note to
        the user.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  force_lock:
    description:
      - By default, when C(dest) is a MVS data set and is being used by another
        process with DISP=SHR or DISP=OLD the module will fail. Use C(force_lock)
        to bypass DISP=SHR and continue with the copy operation.
      - If set to C(true) and destination is a MVS data set opened by another
        process then zos_copy will try to copy using DISP=SHR.
      - Using C(force_lock) uses operations that are subject to race conditions
        and can lead to data loss, use with caution.
      - If a data set member has aliases, and is not a program
        object, copying that member to a dataset that is in use will result in
        the aliases not being preserved in the target dataset. When this scenario
        occurs the module will fail.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  ignore_sftp_stderr:
    description:
      - During data transfer through SFTP, the SFTP command directs content to
        stderr. By default, the module essentially ignores the stderr stream
        produced by SFTP and continues execution. The user is able to override
        this behavior by setting this parameter to C(false). By doing so, any
        content written to stderr is considered an error by Ansible and will
        cause the module to fail.
      - When Ansible verbosity is set to greater than 3, either through the
        command line interface (CLI) using B(-vvvv) or through environment
        variables such as B(verbosity = 4), then this parameter will
        automatically be set to C(true).
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: true
    version_added: "1.4.0"
  is_binary:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), indicates that the file or data set to be copied is a
        binary file or data set.
      - When I(is_binary=true), no encoding conversion is applied to the content,
        all content transferred retains the original state.
      - Use I(is_binary=true) when copying a Database Request Module (DBRM) to
        retain the original state of the serialized SQL statements of a program.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  executable:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), indicates that the file or library to be copied is an executable.
      - If I(executable=true), and C(dest) is a data set, it must be a PDS or PDSE (library).
      - If C(dest) is a nonexistent data set, the library attributes assigned will be
        Undefined (U) record format with a record length of 0, block size of 32760 and the
        remaining attributes will be computed.
      - If C(dest) is a file, execute permission for the user will be added to the file (``u+x``).
      - If the C(src) executable has an alias, the alias will not be copied unless C(aliases=true).
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  aliases:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), indicates that any aliases found in the source
        (USS file, USS dir, PDS/E library or member) are to be preserved during the copy operation.
      - Aliases are implicitly preserved when libraries are copied over to USS destinations.
        That is, when C(executable=True) and C(dest) is a USS file or directory, this option will be ignored.
      - Copying of aliases for text-based data sets from USS sources or to USS destinations is not currently supported.
      - If the C(dest) is Unix, the alias is not visible in Unix, even though the information is there and
        will be visible if copied to a library.
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  local_follow:
    description:
      - This flag indicates that any existing filesystem links in the source tree
        should be followed.
    type: bool
    default: true
    required: false
  group:
    description:
      - Name of the group that will own the file system objects.
      - When left unspecified, it uses the current group of the current user
        unless you are root, in which case it can preserve the previous
        ownership.
      - This option is only applicable if C(dest) is USS, otherwise ignored.
    type: str
    required: false
  mode:
    description:
      - The permission of the destination file or directory.
      - If C(dest) is USS, this will act as Unix file mode, otherwise ignored.
      - It should be noted that modes are octal numbers.
        The user must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser
        knows it is an octal number (like C(0644) or C(01777))or quote it
        (like C('644') or C('1777')) so Ansible receives a string and can do its
        own conversion from string into number. Giving Ansible a number without
        following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which
        will have unexpected results.
      - The mode may also be specified as a symbolic mode
        (for example, ``u+rwx`` or ``u=rw,g=r,o=r``) or a special
        string `preserve`.
      - I(mode=preserve) means that the file will be given the same permissions as
        the source file.
    type: str
    required: false
  owner:
    description:
      - Name of the user that should own the filesystem object, as would be
        passed to the chown command.
      - When left unspecified, it uses the current user unless you are root,
        in which case it can preserve the previous ownership.
      - This option is only applicable if C(dest) is USS, otherwise ignored.
    type: str
    required: false
  remote_src:
    description:
      - If set to C(false), the module searches for C(src) at the local machine.
      - If set to C(true), the module goes to the remote/target machine for C(src).
    type: bool
    default: false
    required: false
  src:
    description:
      - Path to a file/directory or name of a data set to copy to remote
        z/OS system.
      - C(src) can be a alias name of a PS, PDS or PDSE data set.
      - If C(remote_src) is true, then C(src) must be the path to a Unix
        System Services (USS) file, name of a data set, or data set member.
      - If C(src) is a local path or a USS path, it can be absolute or relative.
      - If C(src) is a directory, C(dest) must be a partitioned data set or
        a USS directory.
      - If C(src) is a file and C(dest) ends with "/" or is a
        directory, the file is copied to the directory with the same filename as
        C(src).
      - If C(src) is a directory and ends with "/", the contents of it will be copied
        into the root of C(dest). If it doesn't end with "/", the directory itself
        will be copied.
      - If C(src) is a directory or a file, file names will be truncated and/or modified
        to ensure a valid name for a data set or member.
      - If C(src) is a VSAM data set, C(dest) must also be a VSAM.
      - If C(src) is a generation data set (GDS), it must be a previously allocated one.
      - If C(src) is a generation data group (GDG), C(dest) can be another GDG or a USS
        directory.
      - Wildcards can be used to copy multiple PDS/PDSE members to another
        PDS/PDSE. i.e. Using SOME.TEST.PDS(*) will copy all members from one PDS/E
        to another without removing the destination PDS/E.
      - Required unless using C(content).
    type: str
  validate:
    description:
      - Specifies whether to perform checksum validation for source and
        destination files.
      - Valid only for USS destination, otherwise ignored.
    type: bool
    required: false
    default: false
  volume:
    description:
      - If C(dest) does not exist, specify which volume C(dest) should be
        allocated to.
      - Only valid when the destination is an MVS data set.
      - The volume must already be present on the device.
      - If no volume is specified, storage management rules will be used to
        determine the volume where C(dest) will be allocated.
      - If the storage administrator has specified a system default unit name
        and you do not set a C(volume) name for non-system-managed data sets,
        then the system uses the volumes associated with the default unit name.
        Check with your storage administrator to determine whether a default
        unit name has been specified.

notes:
    - Destination data sets are assumed to be in catalog. When trying to copy
      to an uncataloged data set, the module assumes that the data set does
      not exist and will create it.
    - Destination will be backed up if either C(backup) is C(true) or
      C(backup_name) is provided. If C(backup) is C(false) but C(backup_name)
      is provided, task will fail.
    - When copying local files or directories, temporary storage will be used
      on the remote z/OS system. The size of the temporary storage will
      correspond to the size of the file or directory being copied. Temporary
      files will always be deleted, regardless of success or failure of the
      copy task.
    - VSAM data sets can only be copied to other VSAM data sets.
    - For supported character sets used to encode data, refer to the
      L(documentation,https://ibm.github.io/z_ansible_collections_doc/ibm_zos_core/docs/source/resources/character_set.html).
    - This module uses SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) for the underlying
      transfer protocol; SCP (secure copy protocol) and Co:Z SFTP are not supported. In the
      case of Co:z SFTP, you can exempt the Ansible user id on z/OS from using Co:Z thus falling
      back to using standard SFTP. If the module detects SCP, it will temporarily use SFTP for
      transfers, if not available, the module will fail.
    - Beginning in version 1.8.x, zos_copy will no longer attempt to correct a copy of
      a data type member into a PDSE that contains program objects. You can control this
      behavior using module option C(executable) that will signify an executable is being
      copied into a PDSE with other executables. Mixing data type members with program
      objects will result in a (FSUM8976,./zos_copy.html) error.
    - It is the playbook author or user's responsibility to ensure they have
      appropriate authority to the RACF FACILITY resource class. A user is
      described as the remote user, configured either for the playbook or
      playbook tasks, who can also obtain escalated privileges to execute as
      root or another user.
    - If trying to copy a migrated data set, first recall it before executing this module.
      This module does not perform recalls automatically. See modules L(zos_mvs_raw,./zos_mvs_raw.html)
      and L(zos_tso_cmd,./zos_tso_cmd.html) for examples of how to recall migrated data sets
      using this collection.
