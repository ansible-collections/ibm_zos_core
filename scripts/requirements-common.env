# This original list caused some issues with pytest seeing our conftest plugin
# as already registered, the only time senstive solution I could come up with
# was to pip freeze a working venv and use that as the common base for now, over
# time, using pip show <package> on each of these packages to figure out why
# this occurs or maybe using pipdeptree will visually help.
